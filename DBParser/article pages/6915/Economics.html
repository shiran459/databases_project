<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Subjects_and_objects_in_economics">Subjects and objects in economics</span></h2>
<p>The subjects (actors) in economic study are households, business companies, the government (the state), and foreign countries. <b>Households</b> offer their "<a href="/Factors_of_production" title="Factors of production">factors of production</a>" to companies. This includes work, land, <a href="/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a> (machines, buildings) and information. They get income which they use to buy or 'consume' goods. </p>
<p><b>Business companies</b> produce and sell <a href="/Good_(economics)" title="Good (economics)">goods</a> and <a href="/Service_(economics)" title="Service (economics)">services</a> and buy factors of production from households and from other companies. </p>
<p><b>The state</b> or <a href="/Public_sector" title="Public sector">public sector</a> includes institutions and organisations. The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households, and uses it to pay for "public goods" like <a href="/Street" title="Street">streets</a> or <a href="/Education" title="Education">education</a>, to be available for everyone. The last subject is <b>foreign countries</b>. This includes all households, business companies and state institutions, which are not based in one's own country. They demand and supply goods from abroad.</p>
<p>The objects (things acted upon) in economic study are <a href="/Consumer" title="Consumer">consumer</a> goods, capital goods, and factors of production. Consumer goods are classified as "usage goods" (for example, gasoline or toilet paper), as "purpose goods" (for example, a house or bicycle), and as "services" (for example, the work of a doctor or cleaning lady). Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods. Examples of these are buildings, equipment, and machines. Factors of production are work, ground, capital, information, and <a href="/Environment" title="Environment">environment</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_economic_rules">General economic rules</span></h2>

<ul>
<li>All people have to decide between their options.</li>
<li>The cost of goods is what a person gives up for the goods.</li>
<li>When a person gives up something (like money) to get a good, they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead.  This means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it.  This includes <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a>, and the economic benefits ("utility") that you didn't get because you can no longer buy something else.This is called <a href="/Opportunity_cost" title="Opportunity cost">opportunity cost</a>.</li>
<li>People react to encouragements ("incentives"). Making an option more attractive will make more people choose it.</li>
<li>Trade can make everyone better off.</li>
<li>Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life. In the <a href="/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a>, goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions. The “invisible hand” of the market (<a href="/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>) states that if everyone tries to get what they want, everyone will be as well-off as they could possibly be.</li>
<li>Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society. For example, <a href="/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> is bad for society, and education is good for society. The government can put a tax (or do something to reduce sales) on items that are bad for society. It can also support (like giving money for) items that are good for society.</li>
<li>The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods. Productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours. </li>
<li>When there is an increase in the total money supply, or when the cost to produce things rises, prices go up. This is called <a href="/Inflation" title="Inflation">inflation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Economists are strongly influenced by the times they live in.  For example, <a href="/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> lived in a time where <a href="/Worker" title="Worker">workers</a>' conditions were very poor, and <a href="/John_Maynard_Keynes" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a> lived through the <a href="/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s. Today's economists can look back and understand why they made their judgments, and try to make better ones.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Branches_of_economics">Branches of economics</span></h2>
<p>The two main branches of economics are <a href="/Microeconomics" title="Microeconomics">microeconomics</a> and <a href="/Macroeconomics" title="Macroeconomics">macroeconomics</a>.  </p>
<p>Macroeconomics is about the economy in general.  For example, if a country's wealth goes up or if millions of people become unemployed, those are things that macroeconomists study.  Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money or how a business operates.</p>
