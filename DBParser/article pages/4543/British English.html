<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pronunciation_in_British_English">Pronunciation in British English</span></h2>
<p>In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example, a man from a place near <a href="/London" title="London">London</a> may not pronounce his "r"s the same as a man from <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> or a man from <a href="/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Across the country, the accent is different. For instance, in <a href="/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, one speaks with a "scouse" accent, and in <a href="/London" title="London">London</a>, one speaks with a "cockney" accent. Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt. One place people speak English in a different way is <a href="/Cornwall" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, where the <a href="/Cornish_dialect" title="Cornish dialect">Cornish dialect</a> is spoken. </p>

<p>Britain, like other countries, has languages other than English.

However, that is not the subject of this particular article.</p>
