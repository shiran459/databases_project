<p>A <b>tone language</b> or <b>tonal language</b> is a <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a> in which saying <a href="/Word" title="Word">words</a> with different "tones" (which are like <a href="/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch (music)">pitches in music</a> but with a smaller number) changes the <a href="/Meaning" title="Meaning">meaning</a> of a word even if the <a href="/Pronunciation" title="Pronunciation">pronunciation</a> of the word is otherwise the same.</p>
<p>Many Asian languages are tone languages, such as <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, <a href="/Vietnamese_language" title="Vietnamese language">Vietnamese</a>, <a href="/Thai_language" title="Thai language">Thai</a>, and <a href="/Punjabi" title="Punjabi">Punjabi</a>. Most languages, including those that come from <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> like English, are not tone languages.</p>
<p>In some languages, it is <a href="/Pitch_accent" title="Pitch accent">pitch accent</a> that is important instead. That means that a word's meaning can be different if a different <a href="/Syllable" title="Syllable">syllable</a> is stressed. Examples include <a href="/Swedish_language" title="Swedish language">Swedish</a>, <a href="/Norwegian_language" title="Norwegian language">Norwegian</a>, <a href="/Serbo-Croatian" title="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a>, <a href="/Lithuanian_language" title="Lithuanian language">Lithuanian</a>, and some Asian languages like <a href="/Japanese_language" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>. However, pitch accent is not the same as tones.</p>
<p>Some tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language. They are the most difficult part of learning a tone language for those people.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Example">Example</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="/Mandarin_language" title="Mandarin language">Mandarin</a>, the sentence <i>ma ma ma ma</i> ({{lang|cmn|麻媽罵馬}}) includes four different words. If numbers identify the tones, they can be written <i>ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3</i>, which means "the <a href="/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>'s mother scolds the <a href="/Horse" title="Horse">horse</a>." Some ways of <a href="/Romanization" title="Romanization">romanization</a> write each tone with a different spelling; <i>ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3</i> in <a href="/Pinyin" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> would be written <i>ma mha mah maa</i> in <a href="/Gwoyeu_Romatzyh" title="Gwoyeu Romatzyh">Gwoyeu Romatzyh</a> romanization. Most use numbers or <a href="/Diacritic" title="Diacritic">accent marks</a> (<i>mā má mǎ mà</i> in Pinyin). There is a <a href="/Poem" title="Poem">poem</a> called <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den">Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den</a> ({{lang|zh|施氏食獅史}}). It has 92 <a href="/Chinese_character" title="Chinese character">characters</a>; all read the same way in Mandarin ("shi") but with different tones.</p>
<p>Mandarin does not have many <a href="/Syllable" title="Syllable">syllables</a>: the words for "mother," "hemp," "horse," "scold," and a word put at the end of sentences to make it a question are all pronounced "ma:"
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Mother" is "ma" that is high and level.</li>
<li>"Hemp" is "ma" that starts low and ends high.</li>
<li>"Horse" is "ma" that starts fairly high, dips very low, and then goes back up again.</li>
<li>"Scold" is "ma" that starts high and ends low.</li>
<li>To make a question, "ma" is added at the end, but it is kept very soft and short and about the same level.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mandarin has "first tone," "second tone," "third tone," "fourth tone," and "neutral tone." Other Chinese <a href="/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialects</a> have more tones, some as many as 12.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tonal_markings">Tonal markings</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Vietnamese_language" title="Vietnamese language">Vietnamese</a> and <a href="/Pinyin" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> use accents as the <a href="/Tonality" title="Tonality">tone</a> <a href="/Mark" title="Mark">marks</a> for the <a href="/Latin_alphabet" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>. Each accent shows an altered sound for the <a href="/Syllable" title="Syllable">syllable</a>. Most syllables have only one tone marking, but the letters in the syllable can be altered by other markings. Syllables usually form one word in un-<a href="/Hyphen" title="Hyphen">hyphenated</a> <a href="/Compound_word" title="Compound word">compound</a> words.</p>
<p>Pinyin may have style differences that break from actual use because its use is to help Westerners. Vietnamese, on the other hand, has a national script that always follows the uses the sAme style.</p></div>
