<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

<p>England was named after a <a href="/Denmark" title="Denmark">Germanic</a> tribe called the "<a href="/Angles" title="Angles">Angles</a>", who settled in Central, Northern, and Eastern England in the 5th century. A related tribe called the "<a href="/Saxons" title="Saxons">Saxons</a>" settled in the south of England. That is why that period of English history is called "Anglo-Saxon". For the majority of this time, England did not exist as a united country. The <a href="/Anglo-Saxons" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> lived in many small kingdoms, which slowly united. The later countries of England and Wales were formed from the earlier <a href="/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a>.</p>
<p>England became one country in <a href="/937" title="937">937</a>. The first King of England was <a href="/Athelstan" title="Athelstan">Athelstan</a>, but he lost a lot of land to <a href="/Danelaw" title="Danelaw">Danish invaders</a>, who formed their own country in the East and North. Many villages and towns in this area (particularly in <a href="/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="/Lincolnshire" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>), still have Danish names, and use some Danish-based words. At one time <a href="/Wessex" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> (in the West of England) was the only English kingdom left. After many battles, King <a href="/Alfred_the_Great" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a> of Wessex became king of the whole of England, and the old kingdoms (Mercia, <a href="/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, etc.) just became <a href="/Province" title="Province">provinces</a>, called "Earldoms" governed by an "<a href="/Earl" title="Earl">Earl</a>". Soon after Alfred died, the king of Denmark (Knut or <a href="/Canute" title="Canute">Canute</a>) ruled England.</p>
<p>England soon had an English king again. When King <a href="/Edward_the_Confessor" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> died, Harold (the Earl of Wessex) became king. <a href="/William_the_Conqueror" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, Duke of <a href="/Normandy" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> (today part of northern France), said that <a href="/Harold_Godwinson" title="Harold Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a> had promised to make William the king, so he invaded England and fought King Harold at the <a href="/Battle_of_Hastings" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> in 1066.</p>
<p>William won, and then became king of England. The kings of England spoke French for the next 300 years (The present ruler, <a href="/Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> is a descendant of William, but not very directly). England took over the country of <a href="/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> in the 13th century. There were many wars, often against <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> and <a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>For many centuries the religion of England was <a href="/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>. The <a href="/Bishop" title="Bishop">bishops</a> (church leaders) of England and all their churches obeyed the <a href="/Pope" title="Pope">pope</a> and the church in <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>. During the <a href="/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> many of the bishops did not agree with this. In the 1530s, the Pope told King <a href="/Henry_VIII" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a> that he could not divorce his wife. King Henry VIII created the <a href="/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> (a "<a href="/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>" church) so that he could divorce his wife, and made it the <a href="/State_religion" title="State religion">official church</a> in England. For the next 200 years, there was fighting over whether the King (or Queen) of England should be "Roman Catholic" or "Protestant".</p>
<p>Queen <a href="/Elizabeth_I" title="Elizabeth I">Elizabeth I</a> was Henry's second daughter. She was a powerful queen who ruled for more than 40 years. When Queen Elizabeth I died, she had no children, and in 1603 <a href="/James_VI_of_Scotland" title="James VI of Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a> (the son of <a href="/Mary%2C_Queen_of_Scots" title="Mary, Queen of Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>) became King <a href="/James_I_of_England" title="James I of England">James I of England</a>. He called his two countries "Great Britain", but they were still separate countries with their own <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">parliaments</a> and laws, even though they were in <a href="/Personal_union" title="Personal union">personal union</a>.</p>
<p>James' son, <a href="/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> and the English Parliament fought each other in the <a href="/English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> (<a href="/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> were involved as well, but the story is complicated!). Oliver Cromwell became leader of the Parliamentary Army (the "Roundheads") and defeated the Royalist Army (the "Cavaliers"). King Charles was beheaded in 1649 and <a href="/Oliver_Cromwell" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> became <a href="/Dictator" title="Dictator">dictator</a> ("Lord Protector"). When Cromwell died, his son Richard was not strong enough to rule, and King <a href="/Charles_II" title="Charles II">Charles II</a>, the son of Charles I, was invited to come to England and be king in 1660.</p>
<p>When King Charles II died, his brother James II was the next king. A lot of people did not like James because he was <a href="/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a>. England was invaded by <a href="/William_III_of_England" title="William III of England">William of Orange</a> (ruler of part of the Netherlands and husband of Mary, the daughter of King James). Many people welcomed William because he was a <a href="/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>. James left the country without a fight and Parliament asked William and Mary to become King and Queen together. When <a href="/Mary_II_of_England" title="Mary II of England">Mary II of England</a> died, William ruled alone. Queen Mary's <a href="/Anne_of_Great_Britain" title="Anne of Great Britain">sister Anne</a> became the next queen. While she was queen, England and Scotland were officially joined as one country. This was called the <a href="/Acts_of_Union_1707" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union 1707</a>. It also merged their separate parliaments. The parliament in London now included Scottish <a href="/Member_of_Parliament" title="Member of Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> ("MPs"), and was called the <a href="/Parliament_of_Great_Britain" title="Parliament of Great Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a>.</p>
<p>After this, the history of England becomes the history of <a href="/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom was formed in 1800, when the <a href="/Irish_Parliament" title="Irish Parliament">Irish Parliament</a> merged with the British one. Later Ireland fought against this merging and the <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, which is not quite the whole island called Ireland, became a separate country. The rest of the island, <a href="/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, is now the only part of Ireland still in the UK. England is the only country of UK not to have its own government, Parliament or Assembly, but to be Governed by <a href="/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> which it has a majority of seats in.</p>
