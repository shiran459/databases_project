<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_zero">History of zero</span></h2>
<p>The idea of zero was first thought about in <a href="/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>, <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> and in <a href="/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> at different times. Some places and countries did not know about a zero, which may have made it harder for those people to do <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>. In India, zero was first discovered by the 7th century mathematician Bramhaguptha. </p>
<p>Over hundreds of years the idea of zero was passed from country to country. From <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> and <a href="/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a> to other places, like <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="/Persia" title="Persia">Persia</a> and the <a href="/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> parts of the world. The <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europeans</a> learned about zero from the <a href="/Arab" title="Arab">Arabs</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_place_of_zero_as_a_number">The place of zero as a number</span></h2>
<p>Zero is almost never used as a place number (<a href="/Ordinal_number" title="Ordinal number">ordinal number</a>). This means that it is not used like 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the order, or place, of something, like 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. An exception to this is seen in many programming languages.</p>
<p>Some other things about zero:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The number zero is a <a href="/Whole_number" title="Whole number">whole number</a>.</li>
<li>The number zero is not a <a href="/Positive_number" title="Positive number">positive number</a>.</li>
<li>The number zero is not a <a href="/Negative_number" title="Negative number">negative number</a>, either.</li>
<li>The number zero is a <a href="/Neutral_number" title="Neutral number">neutral number</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any number <a href="/Division_(mathematics)" title="Division (mathematics)">divided</a> by itself equals one, except if that number is zero. In symbols:</p>
<p>0 ÷ 0 = "<a href="/Division_by_zero" title="Division by zero">not a number.</a>"</p>
<p>In <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a>, zero means "<a href="/Now" title="Now">now</a>". For example, when a person is <a href="/Counting" title="Counting">counting</a> down the time to the start of something, such as a foot race or when a <a href="/Rocket" title="Rocket">rocket</a> takes off, the count is: "three, two, one, zero (or <i>go</i>)". Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the <a href="/Rocket" title="Rocket">rocket</a> takes off into the sky.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="0_as_a_number">0 as a number</span></h2>
<p>0 is the <a href="/Integer" title="Integer">integer</a> that precedes the positive <a href="/1_(number)" title="1 (number)">1</a>, and follows <a href="/-1_(number)" title="-1 (number)">−1</a>. In most (if not all) numerical systems, 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. It means "courageous one" in <a href="/Hieroglyphics" title="Hieroglyphics">hieroglyphics</a>.</p>
<p>Zero is a number which means an amount of <a href="/Null" title="Null">null</a> size; that is, if the number of your brothers is zero, that means the same thing as having no brothers, and if something has a weight of zero, it has no weight. If the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero, it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts, the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before you count the first item and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted, zero remains the final result.</p>
<p>While mathematicians all accept zero as a number, some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number, arguing that one cannot have zero of something. Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero, one has a specific quantity of money in that account, namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others.</p>
<p>Normally speaking, there was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD. More exactly, almost all <a href="/Historian" title="Historian">historians</a> leave out the <a href="/Year_zero" title="Year zero">year zero</a> from the <a href="/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar" title="Proleptic Gregorian calendar">proleptic Gregorian</a> and <a href="/Proleptic_Julian_calendar" title="Proleptic Julian calendar">Julian calendars</a> (that is, from the normal calendar used in English-speaking countries), but <a href="/Astronomer" title="Astronomer">astronomers</a> include it in these same calendars. However, the phrase <a href="/Year_Zero_(political_notion)" title="Year Zero (political notion)">Year Zero</a> may be used to describe any event considered so important, that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="0_as_a_numeral">0 as a numeral</span></h2>
<p><a class="image" href="/File:71px-Text_figures_036.svg.png"><img class="location-right" src="/71px-Text_figures_036.svg.png" width="71"/>
</a>
The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with <a href="/Text_figures" title="Text figures">text figures</a>, 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x.</p>


<p>On the <a href="/Seven-segment_display" title="Seven-segment display">seven-segment displays</a> of calculators, watches, etc., 0 is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments. The four-segment 0 is not common.</p>
<p>The <i>number</i> zero (as in the "zero brothers" example above) is not the same as the <i>numeral</i> or <i>digit</i> zero, used in <a href="/Numeral_system" title="Numeral system">numeral systems</a> using <a href="/Positional_notation" title="Positional notation">positional notation</a>. Successive positions of digits have higher values, so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system. Something called <a href="/Bijective_numeration" title="Bijective numeration">bijective numeration</a> is a possible example of a system without zeroes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_numerical_digit_zero">The numerical digit zero</span></h2>
<p><b>0</b> (<b>zero</b>) is also used as a <a href="/Numerical_digit" title="Numerical digit">numerical digit</a> used to represent that number in <a href="/Numeral" title="Numeral">numerals</a>. It is used to hold the place of that digit, because correct placing of digits affects a numeral's value.</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the numeral 10, which stands for one times ten and zero units (or ones).</li>
<li>In the numeral 100, which stands for one times a hundred plus zero tens plus zero units.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Telling_zero_and_the_letter_O_apart">Telling zero and the letter O apart</span></h2>

<p><a class="image" href="/File:Zero_o_comparison.svg.png" title="A comparison of the letter O and the number 0"><img alt="A comparison of the letter O and the number 0" class="location-right" src="/Zero_o_comparison.svg.png" width="220"/>
</a>
The number 0 and the letter O are both round, so what is the difference? The difference is important on a computer. For one thing, a computer will not do arithmetic with the letter O, because it does not know that it should have been a zero.</p>
<p>The oval-shaped zero and circular letter <a href="/O" title="O">O</a> came into use together on modern character displays. The zero with a dot in the centre seems to have begun as a choice on IBM 3270 controllers (this has the problem that it looks like the <a href="/Greek_alphabet" title="Greek alphabet">Greek letter</a> <a href="/Theta_(letter)" title="Theta (letter)">theta</a>). The slashed zero, looking like the letter O with a diagonal line drawn inside it, is used in old-style ASCII graphic sets that came from the default typewheel on the well-known ASR-33 Teletype. This format causes problems because it looks like the symbol <span class="math">\emptyset</span>, representing the <a href="/Empty_set" title="Empty set">empty set</a>, as well as for certain Scandinavian languages which use Ø as a letter.</p> 
<p>The rule which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers; this is even more of a problem for <a href="/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavians</a> because it looks like two of their letters at the same time. Some Burroughs/Unisys computers display a zero with a backwards slash. And yet another convention common on early line <a href="/Computer_printer" title="Computer printer">printers</a> left zero without any extra dots or slashes but added a tail or hook to the letter O so that it resembled an inverted <a href="/Q" title="Q">Q</a> or cursive capital letter O.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="/File:Deutsches_Kfz-Kennzeichen_f%C3%BCr_Beh%C3%B6rdenfahrzeuge_(Nummernbereich_3).jpg" title="A German licence plate showing zeroes"><img alt="A German licence plate showing zeroes" class="location-right  type-thumbnail" src="/Deutsches_Kfz-Kennzeichen_f%C3%BCr_Beh%C3%B6rdenfahrzeuge_(Nummernbereich_3).jpg"/>
</a>
<div class="thumbnailcaption">A German licence plate showing zeroes</div>
The letters used on some European number plates for <a href="/Automobile" title="Automobile">cars</a> make the two symbols look different. This is done by making the zero rather egg-shaped and the O more circular, but most of all by cutting open the zero on the upper right side, so the circle is not closed any more (as in <a href="/Image:Deutsches_Kfz-Kennzeichen_f%C3%BCr_Beh%C3%B6rdenfahrzeuge_(Nummernbereich_3).jpg" title="Image:Deutsches Kfz-Kennzeichen für Behördenfahrzeuge (Nummernbereich 3).jpg">German plates</a>). The style of letters chosen is called <i><a href="/Image:FE-Schrift.svg" title="Image:FE-Schrift.svg">fälschungserschwerende Schrift</a></i> (abbr.: <i>FE Schrift</i>), meaning "script which is harder to falsify". But those used in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> do not make the letter o and the number 0 look different from each other, because there can never be any mistake if the letters are correctly spaced.</p>
<p>In paper writing you do not have to make the 0 and O look different at all. Or you may add a slash across the zero in order to show the difference, although this sometimes causes mistakes in the number 0.</p>
<p>==Zeroes of a function== 
Functions are explained in the <a href="/Function_(mathematics)" title="Function (mathematics)">Function (mathematics)</a> article. If the function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) = 0, then <i>x</i> is called a zero of the function <i>f</i>. For example, if the function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 1, then the zeroes of the function are +1 and −1, because <i>f</i>(+1) = (+1)<sup>2</sup> − 1 = 0, and <i>f</i>(−1) = (−1)<sup>2</sup> − 1 = 0.</p>
<p>Zeroes of a function are used because they are another way to talk about solving an <a href="/Equation" title="Equation">equation</a>, which is a main goal in <a href="/Algebra" title="Algebra">algebra</a>. If we want to solve an equation like <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> = 1, then we can subtract the right-hand side of the equation from both sides, in this case 1. Whatever we get on the left-hand side, in this case <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 1, can be called a function  <i>f</i>(x). The right-hand side has to be zero, because we subtracted it from itself. So <i>f</i>(x) = 0. Finding the zeroes of this function is the same as solving this equation. In the paragraph before, the zeroes of this function are +1 and −1, so they are the solutions of this equation. We got this equation by subtracting the same thing from both sides, so we also have solutions to the equation we started with, in this case <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> = 1. So if we could find zeroes of functions, we could solve any equation.</p>
