<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Satire">Satire</span></h3>
<p>The ancient Greeks had comedies, which were presented in <a href="/Competition" title="Competition">competitions</a> at the <a href="/Festival" title="Festival">festival</a> of <a href="/Dionysus" title="Dionysus">Dionysia</a>. </p>
<p>One of the best-known comedy authors of the time was <a href="/Aristophanes" title="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> (about 446{{ndash}}386 BC). One of his works, <i><a href="/The_Clouds" title="The Clouds">The Clouds</a></i> was performed 425 BC. The work did not survive completely, but a later version did survive. It is a satire against <a href="/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>, and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist. Some of the accusations were re-used at Socrates' <a href="/Trial" title="Trial">trial</a>, twenty years later.  </p>
<p>Typical for satire are that the author criticizes society, and living people. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Satyr_plays">Satyr plays</span></h3>
<p>Another type of Ancient Greek theatre was the <a href="/Satyr_play" title="Satyr play">satyr play</a>. This was mock <a href="/Drunkenness" title="Drunkenness">drunkenness</a>, brazen <a href="/Sexuality" title="Sexuality">sexuality</a> (including <a href="/Phallus" title="Phallus">phallic</a> props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment. The modern equivalent would be knock-about comedy.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Humour">Humour</span></h3>
<p>Humour, or 'New Comedy' is not about criticizing people or ideas, but rather about showing characters in funny situations. The most important Greek playwright of this type was probably <a href="/Menander" title="Menander">Menander</a>. The best known <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> comedy writer was <a href="/Plautus" title="Plautus">Plautus</a>. He often used Greek comedies for his plays.</p>
<p>Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer <a href="/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>.
Shakespeare's comedy plays include:<i> <a href="/All%E2%80%99s_Well_That_Ends_Well" title="All’s Well That Ends Well">All’s Well That Ends Well</a>, <a href="/The_Comedy_of_Errors" title="The Comedy of Errors">The Comedy of Errors</a>, <a href="/A_Midsummer_Nights_Dream" title="A Midsummer Nights Dream">A Midsummer Nights Dream</a></i>, and <i><a href="/Twelfth_Night" title="Twelfth Night">Twelfth Night</a></i>. In Shakespeare's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes. Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end. This was unlike a tragedy, where the problems do not work out, usually resulting in someone's death.
The two masks, one was smiling, the other crying, often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy.</p>
