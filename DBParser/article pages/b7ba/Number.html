<p>A <b>number</b> is a <a href="/Concept" title="Concept">concept</a> from <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, used to <a href="/Counting" title="Counting">count</a> or <a href="/Measurement" title="Measurement">measure</a>. Depending on the field of mathematics, where numbers are used, there are different definitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>People use symbols represent numbers; they call them <a href="/Numeral" title="Numeral">numerals</a>. Common places where numerals are used are for labeling, as in <a href="/Telephone_number" title="Telephone number">telephone numbers</a>, for ordering, as in <a href="/Serial_number" title="Serial number">serial numbers</a>, or to put a unique identifier, as in an <a href="/ISBN" title="ISBN">ISBN</a>, a unique number that can identify a <a href="/Book" title="Book">book</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/Cardinal_number" title="Cardinal number">Cardinal numbers</a> are used to measure how many items are in a <a href="/Set" title="Set">set</a>. {A,B,C} has size "3".</li>
<li><a href="/Ordinal_number" title="Ordinal number">Ordinal numbers</a> are used to specify a certain element in a <a href="/Set" title="Set">set</a> or <a href="/Sequence" title="Sequence">sequence</a> (<i>first</i>, <i>second</i>, <i>third</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Numbers are also used for other things besides counting. Numbers are used when things are <a href="/Measure" title="Measure">measured</a>. Numbers are used to study how the world works. <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things. The study of the rules of the natural world is called <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a>. The work that uses numbers to make things is called <a href="/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Numbers_for_people">Numbers for people</span></h3>
<p>There are different ways of giving symbols to numbers. These methods are called number systems. The most common number system that people use is the <i>base ten</i> number system. The <i>base ten</i> number system is also called the <i>decimal</i> number system. The base ten number system is common because people have ten <a href="/Finger" title="Finger">fingers</a> and ten <a href="/Toe" title="Toe">toes</a>. There are 10 different symbols {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9} used in the base ten number system. These ten symbols are called digits.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>A symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits. The position of the digits shows how big the number is. For example, the number 23 in the decimal number system really means (2 times 10) plus 3, and 101 means 1 times a hundred (=100) plus 0 times 10 (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Numbers_for_machines">Numbers for <a href="/Machine" title="Machine">machine</a>s</span></h3>
<p>Another number system is more common for machines. The machine number system is called the <i><a href="/Binary" title="Binary">binary</a></i> number system. The binary number system is also called the base two number system. There are two different symbols (0 and 1) used in the base two number system. These two symbols are called bits.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols. The position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is. For example, the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0, and 101 means 1 times four (=4) plus 0 times two (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1). The binary number 10 is the same as the decimal number 2. The binary number 101 is the same as the decimal number 5.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Names_of_numbers">Names of numbers</span></h2>
<p>{{seealso|Names of numbers in English}}
English has special names for some of the numbers in the decimal number system that are "<a href="/Exponentiation" title="Exponentiation">powers</a> of ten". All of these power of ten numbers in the decimal number system use just the symbol "1" and the symbol "0". For example, ten tens is the same as ten times ten, or one hundred. In symbols, this is "10 × 10 = 100". Also, ten hundreds is the same as ten times one hundred, or one thousand. In symbols, this is "10 × 100 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000". Some other power of ten numbers also have special names:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/1_(number)" title="1 (number)">1</a> – one</li>
<li><a href="/10_(number)" title="10 (number)">10</a> – ten</li>
<li>100 – one <a href="/Hundred" title="Hundred">hundred</a></li>
<li>1000 – one <a href="/Thousand" title="Thousand">thousand</a></li>
<li><a href="/1%2C000%2C000" title="1,000,000">1,000,000</a> – one <a href="/Million" title="Million">million</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When dealing with larger numbers than this, there are two different ways of naming the numbers in English. Under the "long scale" a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number. It is also called the "British Standard". This scale used to be common in Britain but is not often used in English-speaking countries today. It is still used in some other European nations. Another scale is the "short scale" under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number. This scale is a lot more common in most English-speaking nations today.</p>

<ul>
<li>1,000,000,000 – one <a href="/Billion" title="Billion">billion</a> (short scale), one <a href="/Milliard" title="Milliard">milliard</a> (long scale)</li>
<li>1,000,000,000,000 – one <a href="/Trillion" title="Trillion">trillion</a> (short scale), one <a href="/Billion" title="Billion">billion</a> (long scale)</li>
<li>1,000,000,000,000,000 – one <a href="/Quadrillion" title="Quadrillion">quadrillion</a> (short scale), one <a href="/Names_for_large_numbers" title="Names for large numbers">billiard</a> (long scale)</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_numbers">Types of numbers</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_numbers">Natural numbers</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/Natural_number" title="Natural number">Natural numbers</a></b> are the numbers which we normally use for counting, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. Some people say that 0 is a natural number, too.</p>
<p>Another name for these numbers is <a href="/Positive_numbers" title="Positive numbers">positive numbers</a>. These numbers are sometimes written as +1 to show that they are different from the negative numbers. But not all positive numbers are natural (for example <span class="math">\frac{1}{2}</span> is positive, but not natural).</p>
<p>If 0 is called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the whole numbers. If 0 is not called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the counting numbers. So if the words "natural numbers" are not used, then there will be less confusion about whether zero is included or not. But unfortunately, some say that zero is not a whole number, either, and some say whole numbers can be negative. "Positive integers" and "non-negative integers" are another way to include zero or exclude zero, but only if people know those words.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Negative_numbers">Negative numbers</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/Negative_number" title="Negative number">Negative numbers</a></b> are numbers less than zero.</p>
<p>One way to think of negative numbers is using a <i>number line</i>. We call one point on this line zero. Then we will label (write the name of) every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point it is, for example the point one is one centimeter to the right, the point two is two centimeters to the right.</p>
<p>Now think about a point which is one centimeter to the left of the zero point. We cannot call this point one, as there is already a point called one. We therefore call this point minus 1 (−1) (as it is one centimeter away, but in the opposite direction).</p>
<p>A drawing of a number line is below.</p>
<p><a class="image" href="/File:NumberLineIntegers.svg.png" title="Number line -6 to 6"><img alt="Number line -6 to 6" src="/NumberLineIntegers.svg.png" width="220"/>
</a></p>
<p>All the normal operations of mathematics can be done with negative numbers:</p>
<p>If people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 + (−3) is the same as 5 − 3, and equals 2.</p>
<p>If they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 − (−3) is the same as 5 + 3, and equals 8.</p>
<p>If they <a href="/Multiplication" title="Multiplication">multiply</a> two negative numbers together they get a positive number. For example, −5 times −3 is 15.</p>
<p>If they multiply a negative number by a positive number, or multiply a positive number by a negative number, they get a negative result. For example, 5 times −3 is −15.</p>
<p>As finding the square root of a negative number is impossible as negative times negative equals possitve. We simbolise the square root of a negative number as i.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Integers">Integers</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/Integer" title="Integer">Integers</a></b> are all the natural numbers, all their <a href="/Opposite_number" title="Opposite number">opposites</a>, and the number <a href="/Zero" title="Zero">zero</a>. <a href="/Decimal" title="Decimal">Decimal numbers</a> and fractions are not integers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rational_numbers">Rational numbers</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/Rational_number" title="Rational number">Rational numbers</a></b> are numbers which can be written as <a href="/Fraction_(mathematics)" title="Fraction (mathematics)">fractions</a>. This means that they can be written as <i>a</i> divided by <i>b</i>, where the numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are integers, and <i>b</i> is not equal to 0.</p>
<p>Some rational numbers, such as 1/10, need a <a href="/Finite" title="Finite">finite</a> number of digits after the <a href="/Decimal_point" title="Decimal point">decimal point</a> to write them in <a href="/Decimal" title="Decimal">decimal</a> form. The number one tenth is written in decimal form as 0.1. Numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational. Some rational numbers, such as 1/11, need an <a href="/Infinity" title="Infinity">infinite</a> number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form. There is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point. The number one eleventh is written in decimal form as <a href="/0.0909090909" title="0.0909090909">0.0909090909</a>... .</p>
<p>A <a href="/Percentage" title="Percentage">percentage</a> could be called a rational number, because a percentage like 7% can be written as the fraction 7/100. It can also be written as the decimal 0.07. Sometimes, a <a href="/Ratio" title="Ratio">ratio</a> is considered as a rational number.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Irrational_numbers">Irrational numbers</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/Irrational_numbers" title="Irrational numbers">Irrational numbers</a></b> are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction, but do not have <a href="/Imaginary_numbers" title="Imaginary numbers">imaginary</a> parts (explained later).
</p>


<p>
Irrational numbers often occur in <a href="/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>. For instance if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the <a href="/Square_root" title="Square root">square root</a> of two, which equals 1.414213 ... . This is an irrational number. Mathematicians have <a href="/Mathematical_proof" title="Mathematical proof">proved</a> that the <a href="/Square_root" title="Square root">square root</a> of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.</p>
<p>One well-known irrational number is <a href="/Pi_(mathematical_constant)" title="Pi (mathematical constant)">pi</a>. This is the <a href="/Circumference" title="Circumference">circumference</a> (distance around) of a circle divided by its <a href="/Diameter" title="Diameter">diameter</a> (distance across). This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.1415926535 ... .</p>
<p>An irrational number cannot be fully written down in <a href="/Decimal" title="Decimal">decimal</a> form. It would have an <a href="/Infinity" title="Infinity">infinite</a> number of digits after the decimal point. Unlike 0.333333 ..., these digits would not repeat forever.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Real_numbers">Real numbers</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/Real_number" title="Real number">Real numbers</a></b> is a name for all the sets of numbers listed above:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The rational numbers, including integers</li>
<li>The irrational numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all numbers that do not involve <a href="/Number#Imaginary_numbers" title="Number">imaginary numbers</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Imaginary_numbers">Imaginary numbers</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/Imaginary_number" title="Imaginary number">Imaginary numbers</a></b> are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number <b>i</b>. This number is the <a href="/Square_root" title="Square root">square root</a> of minus one (−1).</p>
<p>There is no number in the real numbers which when <a href="/Squared" title="Squared">squared</a> makes the number −1. Therefore, mathematicians invented a number. They called this number <b>i</b>, or the <b>imaginary unit</b>.</p>
<p>Imaginary numbers operate under the same rules as real numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The sum of two imaginary numbers is found by pulling out (factoring out) the <b>i</b>. For example, 2<b>i</b> + 3<b>i</b> = (2 + 3)<b>i</b> = 5<b>i</b>.</li>
<li>The difference of two imaginary numbers is found similarly.  For example, 5<b>i</b> − 3<b>i</b> = (5 − 3)<b>i</b> = 2<b>i</b>.</li>
<li>When multiplying two imaginary numbers, remember that <b>i</b> × <b>i</b> (i<sup>2</sup>) is −1.  For example, 5<b>i</b> × 3<b>i</b> = ( 5 × 3 ) × ( <b>i</b> × <b>i</b> ) = 15 × (−1) = −15.</li>
</ul>

<p>Imaginary numbers were called <i>imaginary</i> because when they were first found, many mathematicians did not think they existed.{{Fact|date=April 2009}} The person who <i>discovered</i> imaginary numbers was <a href="/Gerolamo_Cardano" title="Gerolamo Cardano">Gerolamo Cardano</a> in the 1500s. The first to use the words <i>imaginary number</i> was <a href="/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" title="René Descartes">René Descartes</a>. The first people to use these numbers were <a href="/Leonard_Euler" title="Leonard Euler">Leonard Euler</a> and <a href="/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="Carl Friedrich Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>.

<p><b><a href="/Complex_number" title="Complex number">Complex numbers</a></b> are numbers which have two parts; a <i>real</i> part and an <i>imaginary</i> part. Every type of number written above is also a complex number.</p>
<p>Complex numbers are a more general form of numbers. The complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane. This is composed of a real number line, and an imaginary number line.</p>

<p>All of normal mathematics can be done with complex numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To add two complex numbers, add the real and imaginary parts separately. For example, (2 + 3<b>i</b>) + (3 + 2<b>i</b>)  = (2 + 3) + (3 + 2)<b>i</b>= 5 + 5<b>i</b>.</li>
<li>To subtract one complex number from another, subtract the real and imaginary parts separately.  For example, (7 + 5<b>i</b>) − (3 + 3<b>i</b>) = (7 − 3) + (5 − 3)<b>i</b> = 4 + 2<b>i</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To multiply two complex numbers is complicated. It is easiest to describe in general terms, with two complex numbers a + b<b>i</b> and c + d<b>i</b>.</p>
<p><span class="math">( a + b \mathrm{i} ) \times ( c + d\mathrm{i} ) = a \times c + a \times d\mathrm{i} + b\mathrm{i} \times c + b\mathrm{i} \times d\mathrm{i} = ac + ad\mathrm{i} + bc\mathrm{i} -bd = ( ac - bd ) + ( ad + bc )\mathrm{i}</span></p>
<p>For example, (4 + 5<b>i</b>) × (3 + 2<b>i</b>) = (4 × 3 − 5 × 2) + (4 × 2 + 5 × 3)<b>i</b> = (12 − 10) + (8 + 15)<b>i</b> = 2 + 23<b>i</b>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transcendental_numbers">Transcendental numbers</span></h3>
<p>A real or complex number is called a <i><a href="/Transcendental_number" title="Transcendental number">transcendental number</a></i> if it can <b>not</b> be obtained as a result of an algebraic equation with integer coefficients.</p>
<p><span class="math"> a_{n}x^{n} + \dots + a_{2}x^2 + a_{1}x + a_{0} = 0 </span></p>
<p>Proving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult. Each transcendental number is also an irrational number. The first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were <a href="/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" title="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> and <a href="/Leonhard_Euler" title="Leonhard Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>.
