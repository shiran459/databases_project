<p><b>Computer software</b> (often called just <b>software</b>) is a set of instructions and associated documentation that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task or it can mean all the software on a computer, including the <a href="/Computer_program" title="Computer program">applications</a> and the <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a>.  Applications are programs that do a specific thing, such as a game or a <a href="/Word_processor" title="Word processor">word processor</a>.  The operating system (<a href="/Mac_OS" title="Mac OS">Mac OS</a>, <a href="/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a>, etc.) is software that helps the applications run, and controls the display and the keyboard.</p>
<p>The word software was first used in the late <a href="/1960s" title="1960s">1960s</a> to show the difference from <a href="/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">computer hardware</a>, which are the parts of a machine that can be seen and touched.  Software is the instructions that the computer follows. Before <a href="/Compact_disc" title="Compact disc">compact discs</a> (CDs) or <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> <a href="/Download" title="Download">downloads</a>, software came on various <a href="/Computer_data_storage" title="Computer data storage">computer data storage</a> media like paper <a href="/Punched_card" title="Punched card">punch cards</a>, magnetic <a href="/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">discs</a> or <a href="/Magnetic_tape" title="Magnetic tape">magnetic tape</a>. </p>
<p>If you compare computers to <a href="/Music" title="Music">music</a> and <a href="/Musical_instrument" title="Musical instrument">musical instruments</a> you can think of hardware as being the instruments and software being the musical notes. </p>
<p>The word <i><a href="/Firmware" title="Firmware">firmware</a></i> is sometimes used to describe a style of software that is made specially for a particular type of computer (or other electronic device) and is usually stored on a <a href="/Flash_memory" title="Flash memory">Flash memory</a> or <a href="/ROM" title="ROM">ROM</a> chip in the computer. Firmware usually refers to a piece of software that directly controls a piece of hardware, for example the firmware for a CD drive or the firmware for a <a href="/Modem" title="Modem">modem</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Categories">Categories</span></h2>
<p>Computer software can be put into categories based on common function, type, or field of use. There are three broad classifications: 
</p>
<ol>
<li><i><a href="/Application_software" title="Application software">Application software</a></i> are the computer programs for performing user tasks such as <a href="/Word_processing" title="Word processing">word processing</a> and <a href="/Web_browsers" title="Web browsers">web browsers</a>. </li>
<li><i><a href="/System_software" title="System software">System software</a></i> is used to start and run computer systems and networks. This includes <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating systems</a>. </li>
<li><i><a href="/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming">Computer programming</a> tools</i> (also known as <i>development software</i>) are used to create application and system software.  This is done by translating and combining <a href="/Source_code" title="Source code">computer program source code</a> and <a href="/Library_(computing)" title="Library (computing)">libraries</a> into <a href="/Random-access_memory" title="Random-access memory">executable RAMs</a>.  These include <a href="/Compiler" title="Compiler">compilers</a> and <a href="/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linkers</a>.</li>
