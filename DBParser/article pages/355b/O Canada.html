From far and wide, O Canada, 
We stand on guard for thee. 
God keep our land glorious and free! 
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee; 
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

<p>Here are the words in French. The words in French and English do not mean the same thing.</p>
<pre>Ô Canada! Terre de nos aĩeux, 
Ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux! 
Car ton bras sait porter l'épée, 
Il sait porter la croix! 
Ton histoire est une épopée 
Des plus brillants exploits. 
Et ta valeur de foi trempée 
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits; 
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits. 
</pre>
<p>("Canada, land of our parents and grandparents, you wear a crown of beautiful flowers! You can carry a sword, and you can carry a cross (for <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>); your whole history is full of the great things you have done. You are brave and faithful, and this will protect our homes and our rights.")</p>
