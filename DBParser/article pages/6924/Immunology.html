<p><b>Immunology</b> is the study of the <b><a href="/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immune system</a></b>. The immune system is the parts of the body which work against <a href="/Infection" title="Infection">infection</a> and <a href="/Parasitism" title="Parasitism">parasitism</a> by other living things. Immunology deals with the working of the immune system in health and diseases, and with malfunctions of the immune system.</p>
<p>An immune system is present in all plants and animals. We know this because biologists have found genes coding for <a href="/Toll-like_receptor" title="Toll-like receptor">toll-like receptors</a> in many different <a href="/Metazoa" title="Metazoa">metazoans</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Janeway"><a href="#_note-Janeway" title="">[1]</a></sup> These toll-like receptors can recognise <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> as 'foreign', and are the starting-point for immune reactions. The type of immunity which is triggered by the toll-like receptors is called <a href="/Innate_immunity" title="Innate immunity">innate immunity</a>. This is because it is entirely <a href="/Heredity" title="Heredity">inherited</a> in our <a href="/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>, and is fully working as soon as our <a href="/Tissue_(biology)" title="Tissue (biology)">tissues</a> and <a href="/Organ_(anatomy)" title="Organ (anatomy)">organs</a> are properly developed. </p>
<p><a href="/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">Vertebrates</a>, <i>and only vertebrates</i>, have a second type of immunity. This is called <a href="/Adaptive_immunity" title="Adaptive immunity">adaptive immunity</a>, because it 'remembers' previous infections. Then, if the same infection occurs again, the reaction is much stronger and faster. This immunological memory "confers a tremendous survival advantage" and with it vertebrates "can survive over a long lifetime in a pathogen-filled environment".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Janeway_b"><a href="#_note-Janeway" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/Innate_immune_system" title="Innate immune system">innate immune system</a> is usually means all of the <a href="/Cell" title="Cell">cells</a> and systems that does not have to be exposed to a particular <a href="/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogen</a> before they can work.  </p>
<p>Innate immunity starts with the <a href="/Skin" title="Skin">skin</a>, which is an excellent barrier to <a href="/Infection" title="Infection">infection</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adaptive_immune_response">Adaptive immune response</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Adaptive immune system}}
The <a href="/Adaptive_immune_system" title="Adaptive immune system">adaptive immune system</a> includes cells and systems that do require previous exposure to a pathogen. It explains the unique ability of the mammalian immune system to remember previous infections and mount a rapid and robust reaction to secondary infections.  This <b>immunological memory</b> is due to the biology of <a href="/T-cell" title="T-cell">T-cells</a> and <a href="/B-cell" title="B-cell">B-cells</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/Vaccine" title="Vaccine">Vaccines</a> boost the acquired immune system by offering weak forms of infection that the body can fight off. The system remembers how to do it again when a stronger infection happens. If the vaccine works, the body can then fight off a serious infection.</p>
<p>The distribution of vaccines and other immune system affecting <a href="/Cure" title="Cure">cures</a> can be considered another level of acquired immune system, one governed by access to <a href="/Vaccination" title="Vaccination">vaccination</a> and <a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a> in general.  The intersection of this with the spread of <a href="/Disease" title="Disease">disease</a> (as studied in <a href="/Epidemiology" title="Epidemiology">epidemiology</a>) is part of the field of <a href="/Public_health" title="Public health">public health</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Errors_and_weaknesses">Errors and weaknesses</span></h3>
<p>Errors of the immune system may cause damage. In <a href="/Autoimmune_disease" title="Autoimmune disease">autoimmune diseases</a>, the body attacks parts of itself because the system mistakes some parts of the body as 'foreign'. Some kinds of <a href="/Arthritis" title="Arthritis">arthritis</a> are caused this way.</p>
<p>Sometimes serious pathogens slip in because their surface is disguised as something the host cell walls can accept. That is how viruses work. Once inside a cell, their genetic material controls the cell. Infections like <a href="/HIV" title="HIV">HIV</a> get in this way, and then attack cells which are the basis of the immune system. Artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an HIV-challenged body, and prevent the onset of <a href="/AIDS" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>.  This is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves every level of that system.  This research during the 1980s and 1990s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the <a href="/Human_body" title="Human body">human body</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_immunology">History of immunology</span></h2>


<p>Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from <a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a> and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known mention of immunity was during the <a href="/Plague_of_Athens" title="Plague of Athens">plague of Athens</a> in 430 BC. <a href="/Thucydides" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> (460–395 BC) noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of some diseases could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 18th century, <a href="/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis" title="Pierre Louis Maupertuis">Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis</a> made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> This and other observations of acquired immunity led to <a href="/Louis_Pasteur" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> (1822–1895) developing <a href="/Vaccination" title="Vaccination">vaccination</a> and the <a href="/Germ_theory_of_disease" title="Germ theory of disease">germ theory of disease</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the <a href="/Miasma_theory_of_disease" title="Miasma theory of disease">miasma theory</a>. It was not until the proofs <a href="/Robert_Koch" title="Robert Koch">Robert Koch</a> (1843–1910) published in 1891 (for which he was awarded a <a href="/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine" title="Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine">Nobel Prize</a> in 1905) that <a href="/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganisms</a> were confirmed as the cause of <a href="/Infectious_disease" title="Infectious disease">infectious disease</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, when the <a href="/Yellow_fever" title="Yellow fever">yellow fever</a> virus was discovered by <a href="/Walter_Reed" title="Walter Reed">Walter Reed</a> (1851–1902).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of <a href="/Humoral_immunity" title="Humoral immunity">humoral immunity</a><sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> and cellular immunity.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Metch"><a href="#_note-Metch" title="">[8]</a></sup> Particularly important was the work of <a href="/Paul_Ehrlich" title="Paul Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a> (1854–1915), who proposed the <a href="/Side-chain_theory" title="Side-chain theory">side-chain theory</a> to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction. The Nobel Prize for 1908 was jointly awarded to Ehrlich and the founder of cellular immunology, <a href="/Ilya_Mechnikov" title="Ilya Mechnikov">Ilya Mechnikov</a> (1845–1916).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The simplest form of immunity is the <a href="/DNA_restriction" title="DNA restriction">DNA restriction</a> system in <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> that prevents <a href="/Infection" title="Infection">infection</a> by <a href="/Bacteriophage" title="Bacteriophage">bacteriophages</a>.</p>
