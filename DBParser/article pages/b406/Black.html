<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_of_black">Origin of <i>black</i></span></h2>
<p>The word black comes from Old English bl√¶c ("black, dark", also, "ink"), from Proto-Germanic *blakkaz ("burned"), and from Proto-Indo-European *bhleg-. In many languages, <i>black</i> has the same meaning as <i>ink</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Black_in_science">Black in science</span></h2>
<p>In science, an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it. Because these objects do not reflect any light, the human <a href="/Eye" title="Eye">eye</a> can't see any color coming from that object. The <a href="/Brain" title="Brain">brain</a> then sees these objects as black.</p>

<p>A way to create black objects is to mix <a href="/Pigment" title="Pigment">pigments</a>. A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment. For example, a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue. By mixing pigments in the right quantities, black can be made.</p>

<p>Because black objects absorb light, they become warmer faster.</p>
