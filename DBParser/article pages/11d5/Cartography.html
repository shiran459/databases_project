<p><b>Cartography</b> is making <a href="/Map" title="Map">maps</a>. It is part of <a href="/Geography" title="Geography">geography</a>.
How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>. Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer.</p>
<p>Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a <a href="/Census" title="Census">census</a> of a whole country. Anyone can make a map, but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps.</p>

Nowadays they are made on a <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> which makes them look neater with accurate images.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Maps are of two main types:
