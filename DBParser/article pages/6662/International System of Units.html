The <b>International System of Units</b> is the standard modern form of the <a href="/Metric_system" title="Metric system">metric system</a>. The name of this system can be shortened or <a href="/Abbreviation" title="Abbreviation">abbreviated</a> to <b>SI</b>, from the <a href="/French_language" title="French language">French</a> name <b><i>S</i></b><i>ystème <b>I</b>nternational d'unités</i>.</p>
<p>The International System of Units is a <a href="/System_of_measurement" title="System of measurement">system of measurement</a> based on 7 base units: the <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">metre</a> (length), <a href="/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a> (mass), <a href="/Second" title="Second">second</a> (time), <a href="/Ampere" title="Ampere">ampere</a> (electric current), <a href="/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">Kelvin</a> (temperature), <a href="/Mole_(unit)" title="Mole (unit)">mole</a> (quantity), and <a href="/Candela" title="Candela">candela</a> (brightness). These base units can be used in combination with each other. This creates <i>SI derived units</i>, which can be used to describe other quantities, such as <a href="/Volume" title="Volume">volume</a>, <a href="/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a>, <a href="/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressure</a>, and <a href="/Velocity" title="Velocity">velocity</a>.</p>
<p>The system is used almost globally. Only <a href="/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, <a href="/Liberia" title="Liberia">Liberia</a>, and the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> do not use SI as their official system of measurement.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ciawf"><a href="#_note-ciawf" title="">[1]</a></sup> In these countries, though, SI is commonly used in science and medicine.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_and_use">History and use</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/Metric_system" title="Metric system">metric system</a> was created in <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> after the <a href="/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> in <a href="/1789" title="1789">1789</a>. The original system only had two standard units, the kilogram and the metre. The metric system became popular amongst scientists.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/1860s" title="1860s">1860s</a>, <a href="/James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> and <a href="/William_Thomson" title="William Thomson">William Thomson</a> (later known as Lord Kelvin) suggested a system with three base units - length, mass, and time. Other units would be derived from those three base units. Later, this suggestion would be used to create the <a href="/Centimetre-gram-second_system_of_units" title="Centimetre-gram-second system of units">centimetre-gram-second system of units</a> (CGS), which used the <a href="/Centimetre" title="Centimetre">centimetre</a> as the base unit for length, the <a href="/Gram" title="Gram">gram</a> as the base unit for mass, and the second as the base unit for time. It also added the <a href="/Dyne" title="Dyne">dyne</a> as the base unit for <a href="/Force" title="Force">force</a> and the <a href="/Erg" title="Erg">erg</a> as the base unit for energy.</p>
<p>As scientists studied <a href="/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> and <a href="/Magnetism" title="Magnetism">magnetism</a>, they realized other base units were needed to describe these subjects. By the middle of the <a href="/20th_century" title="20th century">20th century</a>, many different versions of the metric system were being used. This was very confusing.</p>
<p>In <a href="/1954" title="1954">1954</a>, the 9th <a href="/CGPM" title="CGPM">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> (CGPM) created the first version of the International System of Units. The six base units that they used were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, Kelvin, and candela.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-9cgpm"><a href="#_note-9cgpm" title="">[2]</a></sup> The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in <a href="/1971" title="1971">1971</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-14cgpm"><a href="#_note-14cgpm" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>SI is now used almost everywhere in the world, except in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/Liberia" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> and <a href="/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, where the older <a href="/Imperial_unit" title="Imperial unit">imperial units</a> are still widely used. Other countries, most of them historically related to the <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, are slowly replacing the old imperial system with the metric system or using both systems at the same time.</p>

<p>The SI <b>base units</b> are <a href="/Measurement" title="Measurement">measurements</a> used by scientists and other people around the world. All the other units can be written by combining these seven base units in different ways. These other units are called "derived units".</p>



<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Derived_units">Derived units</span></h3>
<p>Derived units are created by combining the base units. The base units can be divided, multiplied, or raised to <a href="/Exponent" title="Exponent">powers</a>. Some derived units have special names. Usually these were created to make calculations simpler.</p>



<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prefixes">Prefixes</span></h3>
<p>
Very large or very small measurements can be written using <a href="/Prefix" title="Prefix">prefixes</a>. Prefixes are added to the beginning of the unit to make a new unit. For example, the prefix <i>kilo-</i> means "1000" times the original unit and the prefix <i>milli-</i> means "0.001" times the original unit. So one <i><a href="/Kilometre" title="Kilometre">kilometre</a></i> is 1000 metres and one <i><a href="/Milligram" title="Milligram">milligram</a></i> is a 1000th of a <a href="/Gram" title="Gram">gram</a>.</p>
