<p>A <b>verb</b> is a kind of word (<a href="/Part_of_speech" title="Part of speech">part of speech</a>) that tells about an <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/action">action</a> or a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/state">state</a>. It is the main part of a <a href="/Sentence" title="Sentence">sentence</a>:  every sentence has a verb. In <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a>, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show <a href="/Past_tense" title="Past tense">past</a> or present <a href="/Grammatical_tense" title="Grammatical tense">tense</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EngGram"><a href="#_note-EngGram" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Every <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a> in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> &amp; <a href="/Indonesian_language" title="Indonesian language">Indonesian</a>) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the <a href="/Definition" title="Definition">definition</a> above only works well for English verbs.</p>
<p>There are sixteen verbs used in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English_alphabetical_wordlist">Basic English</a>. They are: <i><a href="/Be" title="Be">be</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/do">do</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/have">have</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/come">come</a>, <a href="/Go" title="Go">go</a>, <a href="/See" title="See">see</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/seem">seem</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give">give</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take">take</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/keep">keep</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/make">make</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/put">put</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/send">send</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/say">say</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/let">let</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/get">get</a>.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_word_.27verb.27">The word 'verb'</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>verb</i> originally comes from <i>*were-</i>, a <a href="/Proto-Indo-European_language" title="Proto-Indo-European language">Proto-Indo-European</a> word meaning "a word". It comes to English through the Latin <i>verbum</i> and the Old French <i>verbe</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Verbal_phrase">Verbal phrase</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="/Simple_sentence" title="Simple sentence">simple sentences</a>, the verb may be one word: <i>The cat </i>sat<i> on the mat</i>. However, the verb may be a <a href="/Phrase" title="Phrase">phrase</a>: <i>The cat </i>will sit<i> on the mat</i>. </p>
<p>Verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse: <i>I'm afraid I will need to be going soon</i>. There seem to be three verbal phrases here, which mean something like <i>Sorry, I must go soon</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Verb_forms">Verb forms</span></h2>
<p>In English and many other languages, verbs change their form. This is called <a href="/Inflection" title="Inflection">inflection</a>. Most English verbs have six inflected forms (see the table), but <i>be</i> has eight different forms.</p>



<p>You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same <b>shape</b>. For example, the plain present and the plain form of <i>walk</i> have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past <a href="/Participle" title="Participle">participle</a>. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of <i>be</i> is usually <i>are</i> but the plain form is <i>be</i>. Also, the past of <i>eat</i> is <i>ate</i>, but the past participle is <i>eaten</i>. When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for.</p>
<p>An English sentence must have at least one primary-form verb. Each main <a href="/Clause" title="Clause">clause</a> can only have one primary-form verb.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_Verbs">Kinds of Verbs</span></h2>
<p>English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called <a href="/Lexical_verb" title="Lexical verb">lexical verbs</a>) and <a href="/Auxiliary_verb" title="Auxiliary verb">auxiliary verbs</a>. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: <a href="/Modal_verb" title="Modal verb">modal verbs</a> and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs.</p>



<p>There are several auxiliary verbs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To <i>do</i> (do, does, did)</li>
<li>To <i>be</i> (am, is, are, was, were): Creates a progressive tense</li>
<li>To <b>have</b> (have, has, had): Creates a perfect tense</li>
</ul>

<p>The following verbs are <i>modal auxiliaries</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can</li>
<li>Could</li>
<li>May</li>
<li>Might</li>
<li>Must</li>
<li>Shall</li>
<li>Should</li>
</ul>

<p>Auxiliary verbs also inflect for <a href="/Negation" title="Negation">negation</a>. Usually this is done by adding <i>not</i> or <i>n't</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EngGram_b"><a href="#_note-EngGram" title="">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>You should<b>n't</b> be here.</li>
<li>He is<b>n't</b> at home.</li>
<li>We have<b>n't</b> started yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_of_the_auxiliary_do">Use of the auxiliary <i>do</i></span></h3>
<p>Sometimes the verb <i>do</i> is used with other verbs. It does not really change the meaning, but it can be used to make a strong statement.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I <i>do</i> talk (Present)</li>
<li>I <i>did</i> go (Past)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I <i>don't</i> talk (Present)</li>
<li>I <i>didn't</i> go (Past)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes it comes before the subject. This is called <a href="/Inversion_(linguistics)" title="Inversion (linguistics)">inversion</a>, and it usually means the sentence is a question.
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Do</i> you talk? (Present)</li>
<li><i>Did</i> you go? (Past)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many other languages do not use the verb <i>do</i> as an auxiliary verb.  They use the simple present for <i>do</i>, and the simple past or perfect for <i>did</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tense.2C_aspect.2C_and_mood">Tense, aspect, and mood</span></h2>
<p>Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses. This is not true. There are three main systems related to the verb: <a href="/Tense_(grammar)" title="Tense (grammar)">tense</a>, <a href="/Aspect_(grammar)" title="Aspect (grammar)">aspect</a>, and <a href="/Mood_(grammar)" title="Mood (grammar)">mood</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tense">Tense</span></h3>
<p>Tense is mainly used to say <b>when</b> the verb happens: in the past, present, or future. In order to explain and understand tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which <a href="/Past_tense" title="Past tense">past tense</a>, <a href="/Present_tense" title="Present tense">present tense</a> and <a href="/Future_tense" title="Future tense">future tense</a> are <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/position">positioned</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="/Japanese_language" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a> for example have only two tenses: past and present.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EngGram_c"><a href="#_note-EngGram" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> and <a href="/Indonesian_language" title="Indonesian language">Indonesian</a> verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens.</p>



<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aspect">Aspect</span></h3>
<p>Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two <a href="/Grammatical_aspect" title="Grammatical aspect">aspects</a>: <a href="/Progressive_aspect" title="Progressive aspect">progressive</a> and <a href="/Perfect_aspect" title="Perfect aspect">perfect</a>. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Progressive_aspect">Progressive aspect</span></h4>
<p>English uses the gerund-participle, usually together with the auxiliary <i>be</i> (and its forms am, is, are, was, and were) to show the progressive aspect.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I<b>'m sleeping</b>. (present progressive)</li>
<li>He <b>was studying</b> English last night. (past progressive)</li>
<li>He <b>will be going</b> to the store tomorrow (future progressive)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many other languages, such as <a href="/French_language" title="French language">French</a>, do not use progressive tenses.</p>

<ul>
<li>I<b>'ve seen</b> him twice. (present perfect)</li>
<li>I <b>had lived</b> there for three years. (past perfect)</li>
</ul>

<p>The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope, wish, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>He <b>had intended</b> to bake a cake but ran out of flour.</li>
<li>She <b>had wanted</b>  to buy him a gift but he refused.</li>
</ul>

<p>After <b>If</b>, <b>wish</b> and <b>would rather</b>, the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>If</b> only I <b>had been born</b> standing up!</li>
<li>I <b>wish</b> you <b>had told</b> me that before.</li>
<li>I <b>would rather</b> you <b>had gone</b> somewhere else.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mood">Mood</span></h3>
<p>Finally, English <a href="/Mood" title="Mood">mood</a> is now usually shown by using <a href="/Modal_verb" title="Modal verb">modal verbs</a>. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of <i>be</i> that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I <b>were</b> a bird, I would fly to California.)</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sentence_parts_that_go_with_verbs">Sentence parts that go with verbs</span></h2>
<p>Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them, but these are not always the same for all verbs. The main sentence parts are: <a href="/Subject" title="Subject">subject</a>, <a href="/Object" title="Object">object</a>, <a href="/Complement" title="Complement">complement</a>, and <a href="/Modifier" title="Modifier">modifier</a>. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subjects">Subjects</span></h3>
<p>Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called <a href="/Imperative" title="Imperative">imperatives</a>) usually do not have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold.
</p>
<ul>
<li><u>We</u> <b>need</b> you.</li>
<li><u>The food</u> <b>was</b> good.</li>
<li><u>The small boy</u> with red hair <b>is</b> sleeping.</li>
<li><b>Can</b> <u>you</u> see the car?</li>
<li><b>Come</b> here. (no subject)</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Objects">Objects</span></h3>
<p>Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called <a href="/Transitive_verb" title="Transitive verb">transitive verbs</a>. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., <i>take</i>), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., <i>sleep</i>). Verbs that do not take an object are called <a href="/Transitivity_(grammar)" title="Transitivity (grammar)">intransitive</a> verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called <a href="/Transitivity_(grammar)" title="Transitivity (grammar)">ditransitive</a> verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm sleeping. (no object)</li>
<li>I <b>took</b> <u>the book</u> from him.</li>
<li>I <b>gave</b> <u>him</u> <u>the book</u>. (2 objects)</li>
<li>I <b>am</b> happy. (no object)</li>
<li>I <b>became</b> a teacher. (complement, no object)</li>
<li>I <b>slept</b> in my bed (1 object)</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Complements">Complements</span></h3>
<p>Some verbs can or must be followed by a <a href="/Complement" title="Complement">complement</a>. These verbs are called <a href="/Linking_verbs" title="Linking verbs">linking verbs</a> or <a href="/Copula" title="Copula">copula</a>. In the following examples, the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold.
</p>
<ul>
<li>He <b>is</b> <u>good</u>.</li>
<li>He <b>is</b> <u>a boy</u>.</li>
<li>She <b>became</b> <u>sick</u>.</li>
<li>She <b>became</b> <u>a manager</u>.</li>
<li>It <b>looks</b> <u>nice</u>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modifiers">Modifiers</span></h3>
<p>Verbs can be modified by various <a href="/Modifier" title="Modifier">modifiers</a>, mainly <a href="/Adverb" title="Adverb">adverbs</a>. Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers; it's usually a choice. In the following examples, the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The boy <b>ran</b> <u>quickly</u>.</li>
<li>The <u>freely</u> <b>swinging</b> rope hit him.</li>
</ul>

<p>Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including <a href="/Preposition" title="Preposition">prepositions</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_between_verbs_and_other_words">Differences between verbs and other words</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape. In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Verbs_vs._adjectives">Verbs vs. adjectives</span></h3>
<p>Sometimes a verb and an <a href="/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjective</a> can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle <i>interesting</i> and the adjective <i>interesting</i> look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by <i>very</i>, <i>more</i>, or <i>most</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EngGram_d"><a href="#_note-EngGram" title="">[1]</a></sup> For example, you can say "That is <b>very</b> interesting," so you know <b>interesting</b> is an adjective here. But you cannot say "My teacher is very interesting me in math" because in this sentence <i>interesting</i> is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>He was isolated / He became isolated (<i>isolated</i> is an adjective)</li>
<li>The door was opening / *The door became opening (<i>opening</i> is a verb)</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Verbs_vs._nouns">Verbs vs. nouns</span></h3>
<p>The gerund-particle sometimes looks like a <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a>. This is especially true when it is used as a subject, as in the following example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Running</b> is good for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main differences between these verbs and nouns are: modifiers, number, and object/complement</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Modifiers_2">Modifiers</span></h4>
<p>Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs. So, in "Running regularly is good for you", <i>running</i> is a verb because it is modified by <i>regularly</i>, an adverb.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Number">Number</span></h4>
<p>Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word <a href="/Plural" title="Plural">plural</a>, it is a noun, not a verb. For example, "this drawing is nice" can change to "these drawings are nice", so <i>drawing</i> is a noun. But "drawing trees is fun" cannot change to "drawings trees is fun", so it is a verb here.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Object.2Fcomplement">Object/complement</span></h4>
<p>Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns cannot.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EngGram_e"><a href="#_note-EngGram" title="">[1]</a></sup> So, in "parking the car is hard", <i>parking</i> is a verb because it takes the object <i>the car</i>. But, if you say, "there's no parking", parking may be a noun because it does not have an object.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Verbs_vs._prepositions">Verbs vs. prepositions</span></h3>
<p>Some verbs have become <a href="/Preposition" title="Preposition">prepositions</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EngGram_f"><a href="#_note-EngGram" title="">[1]</a></sup> Again, usually these share a shape with participles. Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Given</b> the problems, I do not think we should go.</li>
<li>We have many helpers, <b>including</b> John.</li>
<li><b>According</b> to the map, we are here.</li>
<li>He went to hospital <b>following</b> the fight.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject. Even if the subject is not written, you can understand what it is. Prepositions do not have a subject.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EngGram_g"><a href="#_note-EngGram" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
