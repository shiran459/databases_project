A <b>prison </b>(also called a<b> jail </b>or<b> gaol</b>) is a <a href="/Building" title="Building">building</a> where convicted criminals are held and incarcerated. Some prisoners are serving long terms or life sentence while some are waiting for trial. Those with short terms are probably locked up in a jail rather than prison. </p>
<p>Prisons are run by the government. Other words for prison include "penitentiary", "jail" or "gaol" (pronounced like "jail"), and "correctional facility".  Some prisons or jails are called satellite camp, normal prison, special prison for death rows and maximum security prison.  Inmates are forced to wear prison <a href="/Uniform" title="Uniform">uniform</a> with different bright colours from orange, blue, green and more depend on the prison.  For instance, some prisoners who are prison workers might wear orange, or some prisoners with bad criminal records wear red uniform or vice versa.</p>

<p>
Male and female inmates are usually kept in separate locations or in separate prisons. Prisons are usually surrounded by <a href="/Wall" title="Wall">walls</a> and <a href="/Gate" title="Gate">gates</a>. There are usually many locked gates inside the prison to control the inmates.</p>
<p>The inmates sleep in small locked rooms called cells. Cells have a <a href="/Bunk_bed" title="Bunk bed">bunk bed</a>, a <a href="/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilet</a>, and a <a href="/Sink" title="Sink">sink</a>. Inmates are allowed to leave their cell every day for <a href="/Exercise" title="Exercise">exercise</a>. Some inmates work in the prison during the day, either in a <a href="/Factory" title="Factory">factory</a> or doing cooking or cleaning. <a href="/Law_enforcement" title="Law enforcement">Law enforcement</a> officers called prison <a href="/Guard" title="Guard">guards</a> watch the inmates. The manager of a prison is called the <a href="/Warden" title="Warden">warden</a>.</p>
<p>Prisons usually also include other buildings and facilities, such as a <a href="/Chapel" title="Chapel">chapel</a>, a library, an exercise yard, a <a href="/Gymnasium" title="Gymnasium">gymnasium</a>, an infirmary (small <a href="/Hospital" title="Hospital">hospital</a>), visiting rooms (for visits from family and <a href="/Lawyer" title="Lawyer">lawyers</a>), kitchens, and accommodation for prison staff.</p>
<p>The <a href="/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> made the "Standard Minimum Rule" for human treatment for prisoners in 1955.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Also the Article 10 of <a href="/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> also affirm the treatment with humanity for them in prison.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Prisons_for_young_people">Prisons for young people</span></h2>
<p>There are special prisons for people under the age of 18 who commit crimes. These inmates are called young offenders or {{broken wikt link|juvenile|juvenile}} offenders.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Controversy">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>Prisons are a <a href="/Controversy" title="Controversy">controversial</a> topic that people have different <a href="/Debate" title="Debate">views</a> about.</p>

<ul>
<li>People who think that we should have prisons say that removing people who commit crimes from society prevents them from committing more crimes and punishes them for their behavior. They also say that putting people in prison may also prevent others who are likely to commit similar crimes from committing them.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>People who think that we should not put people in prisons say that being put in prison makes people more violent and angry. People who commit minor crimes that are sent to prison meet violent criminals. As well, when people are sent to prison, they cannot see their <a href="/Family" title="Family">family</a> or children, which can cause problems for their family. Sometimes people are put in prison who have done nothing wrong. An American theory that is critical of prisons is called the prison industrial complex. People who believe in the prison industrial complex think that private prison companies want lots of people to be put in prison in order to make money.</li>
