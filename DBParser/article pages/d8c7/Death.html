<p>
<b>Death</b> is the end of <a href="/Life" title="Life">life</a> in an <a href="/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a>. All <a href="/Biology" title="Biology">biological</a> and living activity of the living thing stop, including the <a href="/Mind" title="Mind">mind</a> and the <a href="/Sensory_system" title="Sensory system">senses</a>. The usual <a href="/Signs_and_symptoms" title="Signs and symptoms">signal</a> for death is that the <a href="/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> stops beating and cannot be restarted. This can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan, and all living things eventually die.</p>
<p>Living things which have died are normally described as being <b>dead</b>. Death of <a href="/Humans" title="Humans">humans</a> is often investigated for the cause, in case of <a href="/Crime" title="Crime">crime</a> (such as <a href="/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a>) or <a href="/Disease" title="Disease">disease</a> that may continue to kill other humans. About 150,000 people die every day around the world.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-degrey"><a href="#_note-degrey" title="">[1]</a></sup> About two thirds of these people die because of <a href="/Ageing" title="Ageing">age</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-degrey_b"><a href="#_note-degrey" title="">[1]</a></sup> In addition to the physical body, some believe humans also have a <a href="/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a> and believe that the soul can continue without a body (<a href="/Afterlife" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a>), move into another body (<a href="/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>), or cease to exist (<a href="/Annihilationism" title="Annihilationism">annihilationism</a>). <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">Religions</a> have different beliefs about this issue. Many cultures have their own <a href="/Custom" title="Custom">customs</a> and <a href="/Ritual" title="Ritual">rituals</a> to respect the dead.</p>
<p>When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal, those things or events are usually described as being deadly, or fatal. In the case of diseases, they are described as <i>terminal</i>. Humans are no different from any other lifeform. Our bodies have an ability for self-repair, but that ability is limited. Finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called <a href="/Pathology" title="Pathology">pathology</a>. In <a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes. There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes, such as near-drowning in very cold water. If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work, then the moment of death is more difficult to know.</p>

<p>
Death is commonly a sad or unpleasant thing to people. It can make people think about their own death. People might miss or be sad for the person who has died. They might also be sad for the family and friends of the person who has died.</p>
<p>In any society, human death is surrounded by <a href="/Ritual" title="Ritual">ritual</a> - a <a href="/Funeral" title="Funeral">wake</a> or <a href="/Funeral" title="Funeral">funeral</a> is normal.  In some places it was common to <i>eat</i> the dead in a form of <a href="/Ritual" title="Ritual">ritual</a> <a href="/Cannibalism" title="Cannibalism">cannibalism</a>.  But this is no longer common, in part because <a href="/Disease" title="Disease">disease</a> like <a href="/Kuru_(disease)" title="Kuru (disease)">kuru</a> can be passed this way. Human dead bodies are <a href="/Taboo" title="Taboo">taboo</a> in most societies and must be handled in special ways - for a combination of religious and <a href="/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">hygiene</a> reasons.  A human dead body must always be reported in <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a>, to be sure it is disposed of properly.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dealing_with_dead_bodies_and_their_property">Dealing with dead bodies and their property</span></h3>

<p>Finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into <i><a href="/Human_morbidity" title="Human morbidity">human morbidity</a></i> or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an <a href="/Autopsy" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a>.  Some religions do not allow autopsies, because they feel the body is holy. Autopsies are usually required by the <a href="/State" title="State">state</a> if someone dies and people do not know why. The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose, tried to hurt them, or if they died from a sickness.</p>
<p>To prepare for their own death, humans can write a <a href="/Last_will_and_testament" title="Last will and testament">last will and testament</a> to be clear about who gets their <a href="/Property" title="Property">property</a>.  A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an <a href="/Organ_donor" title="Organ donor">organ donor</a>. This might mean giving the whole body to <a href="/Medical_research" title="Medical research">medical research</a>.  It can also save the lives of others by making <a href="/Organ_transplant" title="Organ transplant">organ transplants</a> possible.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Religious_views_of_death">Religious views of death</span></h3>

<p>For a long time, many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die.  This is one of the largest questions of <a href="/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a>. Many people believe there is some form of <a href="/Afterlife" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a>.</p>
<p>Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies, and much property, but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral.  In <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> this ritual still does sometimes occur.  Old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband's relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire.</p>
<p><a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> has a special focus on death because of the state killing of <a href="/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> by the <a href="/Romans" title="Romans">Romans</a>.  In <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a> this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death, and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it.  In <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> itself it is thought to prove that Jesus himself was really <a href="/God" title="God">God</a> and so could lose his body and still have the power of <a href="/Resurrection" title="Resurrection">resurrection</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In <a href="/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> <a href="/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> is believed to occur. Reincarnation is an idea taken from <a href="/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> advises respect for parents and forms of <a href="/Ancestor" title="Ancestor">ancestor</a> <a href="/Worship" title="Worship">worship</a> to respect both dead and living ancestors.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rituals_surrounding_death">Rituals surrounding death</span></h3>

<p>Every <a href="/Ethical_tradition" title="Ethical tradition">ethical tradition</a> including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death.  Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual.  For instance, one may say that <a href="/Organ_transplant" title="Organ transplant">organ transplant</a> is like <a href="/Cannibalism" title="Cannibalism">cannibalism</a>.</p>
<p>Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual.  People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way, and who wish a particular treatment like <a href="/Cremation" title="Cremation">cremation</a> of their body, should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements.  This makes it much easier for their family after they die, since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish.</p>
<p>For the same reason, saying goodbye is important.  Most of the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stress">stress</a> of death seems to come for loved ones who "did not have a chance to say goodbye".</p>
<p>Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created, and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves, can be exchanged by others.</p>
<p>Some ritual, such as seances, claim to allow people to speak to the dead. This is not claimed to be very reliable, both by <a href="/Scientists" title="Scientists">scientists</a> and even by those who do them very often.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparing_for_death">Preparing for death</span></h2>

<p>Aside from wills, goodbyes, organ donations and funerals, there is important personal experience to decide to pass on, or not, when someone knows they may soon die.  Palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives, and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them.  It is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no <a href="/Quality_of_life" title="Quality of life">quality of life</a>.  Human <a href="/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise:</p>
<p><a href="/Elizabeth_Kubler-Ross" title="Elizabeth Kubler-Ross">Elizabeth Kubler-Ross</a> wrote that there were several stages in <a href="/Dying" title="Dying">dying</a>, of which denial was the first, and acceptance was the last.  Recording one's life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a <a href="/Memoir" title="Memoir">memoir</a> or a full <a href="/Autobiography" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a>:</p>
<p>Because events leave <a href="/Living_memory" title="Living memory">living memory</a>, and may only be part of <a href="/Oral_tradition" title="Oral tradition">oral tradition</a>, there are projects to record everything that people remember about <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and the <a href="/Shoah" title="Shoah">Shoah</a>.  The first of these was to record everything remembered about the <a href="/U.S._Civil_War" title="U.S. Civil War">U.S. Civil War</a>.  This discipline has changed <a href="/History" title="History">history</a> since we have so many more <a href="/First_person_account" title="First person account">first person accounts</a> of the times, and made <a href="/Social_history" title="Social history">social history</a> much more standard.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_terms_for_death">Other terms for death</span></h2>
<p>There are other <a href="/Term" title="Term">terms</a> for death. Examples are, "to pass away", "to go to a better place", "to buy the farm" (generally used in the <a href="/Military" title="Military">military</a>), "to leave the earth", and "to kick the bucket". the term <i>gone</i> may also be a term for describing death. <i>for example</i>: if a person has died, they are also said to be <i>gone</i>, as in <i>gone to a better place</i> or <i>no longer here</i>.</p>
