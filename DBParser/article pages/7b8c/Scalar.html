<p><b>Scalars</b> are simple <a href="/Number" title="Number">numbers</a>. They are used for <a href="/Measurement" title="Measurement">measuring</a> things. Many things can be measured, and the measure can be explained by only giving the number.</p>
<p>Suppose we are measuring a <a href="/Rod" title="Rod">rod</a>. We could give the measured <a href="/Length" title="Length">length</a> as 2 <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">metres</a> or 3 cm etc. depending on the length of the rod under observation. Here only the figure 2 or 3 along with the <a href="/Unit" title="Unit">unit</a> of measure is enough to transmit information about the rod.</p>
<p>Other examples of scalars are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit of <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a>. (<a href="/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">Kilograms</a>)</li>
<li>Unit of measuring <a href="/Luminosity" title="Luminosity">luminosity</a>. (<a href="/Candela" title="Candela">Candela</a>)</li>
<li>Unit of length. (Metres)</li>
</ul>

<p>i.e. mass is measured by scalars, <a href="/Distance" title="Distance">distances</a> are measured by scalars.</p>
<p>The other family of measurement falls under the category of <a href="/Vector" title="Vector">vectors</a>.
