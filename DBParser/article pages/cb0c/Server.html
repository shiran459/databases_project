<i>A server is also a person who serves, like a <a href="/Waiter" title="Waiter">waiter</a> at a restaurant or in a hotel</i>

<p>In <a href="/Net_jargon" title="Net jargon">net jargon</a>, a <b>server</b> is a <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> that serves many kinds of information to <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/user">user</a> or <a href="/Client" title="Client">client</a> machines. Usually a server will only do a few things for many clients. Every type of thing a server does is called a service. Services are used by other computers that are called clients. The relationship between client and server is called a <a href="/Client-server" title="Client-server">client-server</a> relationship. For example, <a href="/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> has <a href="/Website" title="Website">web</a> servers which have a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you. A server can also host <a href="/Video_game" title="Video game">internet games</a>, <a href="/File_server" title="File server">share files</a>, and give access to <a href="/Peripheral_equipment" title="Peripheral equipment">peripheral equipment</a> such as printers. In simple words, the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers. These store files and information in the form of website. With an Internet connection, different users anywhere in the world can access these files.</p>
<p>So that servers and clients can talk to each other, they need to be connected to a <a href="/Computer_network" title="Computer network">network</a>, and they need to use the same <a href="/Protocol" title="Protocol">protocol</a>. In networks, a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines. It is just like a language. For example, the Wikipedia server runs the <a href="/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a> to send <a href="/Web_site" title="Web site">web sites</a> to your <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a>, and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages.</p>
<p>Usually, servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable, and they are much more expensive than normal computers. Sometimes, servers can be clustered, which means that lots of servers work together to do one service.</p>
<p>The server might slow down if there are too many people accessing the server at the same time, resulting in a high load. It might also be unable to take the high load, so it will automatically shut down.</p>
<p>In a <a href="/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> system, every computer is both a client and a server to each other. This is commonly put into <a href="/File_sharing" title="File sharing">file sharing</a> and <a href="/VOIP" title="VOIP">VOIP</a>. However, this can help in attempts at <a href="/Copyright_infringement" title="Copyright infringement">piracy</a>.
Many game servers use a large server for players to store their gaming data and can access them anytime with an internet connection. </p>
<p>Typical server operating systems are <a href="/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="/FreeBSD" title="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="/NetBSD" title="NetBSD">NetBSD</a>, and <a href="/OpenBSD" title="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a>. Unlike other computers, a server often has no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. When a server doesn't have to do very much, server software can run on a computer that is also doing other things.</p>

<p>A <b>web server</b> is a type of server that is used to <a href="/Host_(network)" title="Host (network)">host</a> <a href="/Website" title="Website">websites</a>.  
Examples of web server software include <a href="/Apache_HTTP_Server" title="Apache HTTP Server">Apache</a> or <a href="/Internet_information_services" title="Internet information services">IIS</a>. A web server can host one, or many, websites. The <a href="/Default" title="Default">default</a> <a href="/Port_(networking)" title="Port (networking)">port</a> for a web server to <a href="/Listen" title="Listen">listen</a> to is port 80 (<a href="/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a>) or 443 (<a href="/HTTPS" title="HTTPS">HTTPS</a>).</p>
<p>Web servers have different things they can do more than just serving a web page. For example, some web servers have something called <a href="/Server_side_include" title="Server side include">SSI</a> that makes <a href="/Build" title="Build">building</a> a website easier.</p>
<p>Web servers use <a href="/Service" title="Service">services</a> like <a href="/Common_gateway_interface" title="Common gateway interface">CGI</a> to let <a href="/Software" title="Software">software</a> on the server make web pages. Some of the <a href="/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming languages</a> that can use CGI are <a href="/Scripting" title="Scripting">scripting</a> languages like <a href="/Perl" title="Perl">Perl</a>, <a href="/Python" title="Python">Python</a>, <a href="/PHP" title="PHP">PHP</a>, or <a href="/ASP" title="ASP">ASP</a>. Some are <a href="/Compile" title="Compile">compiled</a> languages like <a href="/C%2B%2B" title="C++">C++</a> or <a href="/Java" title="Java">Java</a>.</p>
