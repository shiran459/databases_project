<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Standard_Russian">Standard Russian</span></h2>
<p>Standard Russian is also called modern literary Russian (Современный русский литературный язык). It first appeared at the beginning of the 18th century. At that time <a href="/Peter_the_Great" title="Peter the Great">Peter the Great</a> was working to make the Russian state more modern. Standard Russian grew out of the <a href="/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialect</a> of Russian spoken by people in <a href="/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and the area around Moscow. (A dialect is a local form of a language.) In some ways, Standard Russian was also like the Russian used in government offices in earlier centuries. </p>
<p><a href="/Mikhail_Lomonosov" title="Mikhail Lomonosov">Lomonosov</a> put together the first book on Russian <a href="/Grammar" title="Grammar">grammar</a> in 1755. The <a href="/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="Russian Academy of Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> published the first full dictionary of Russian in 1783. The grammar, <a href="/Vocabulary" title="Vocabulary">vocabulary</a>, and <a href="/Pronunciation" title="Pronunciation">pronunciation</a> of Russian became stable and were standardized at the end of the 18th and in the 19th century. This was the "Golden Age" of <a href="/Russian_literature" title="Russian literature">Russian literature</a>. Russian literature became famous throughout the world. </p>
<p>All of Russia began to use Russian as its language of literature, education, and official communication. Until the 20th century, only the upper <a href="/Social_class" title="Social class">classes</a> and people in cities spoke the literary language. Russians from the countryside continued to speak their local dialects. Starting in the 20th century, all children were required to go to school. Many people had radios and televisions. This helped spread Standard Russian. In the 20th century the dialects of Russian mostly disappeared. They were gone by the middle of the century. Standard Russian replaced them almost completely.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Naming">Naming</span></h2>
<p>In Russian, a person's name has three parts. These are the first name, the second name and the family name. </p>
<p>Parents choose the first name for their child. Some common Russian names for boys are Ivan, Vladimir, Mikhail, and Nikolai. Some common Russian names for girls are Anna, Anastasia, Svetlana and Yekaterina.</p>
<p>The second name is called the <i>patronymic</i>. It comes from the first name of one's father. The Russian word for this is <i>otchestvo</i>. Take, for example, a boy whose father is named <i>Ivan</i>. The boy's patronymic is <i>Ivanovich</i>. Another example: a boy's father is named <i>Nikolai</i>. The boy's patronymic is <i>Nikolaevich</i>. If a girl's father is named <i>Ivan</i>, her patronymic is <i>Ivanovna</i>. If her father is named <i>Nikolai</i>, her patronymic is <i>Nikolaevna</i>. The patronymic of a boy ends with <i>ovich</i> or <i>evich</i>. The patronymic of a girl ends with <i>ovna</i> or <i>evna</i>. </p>
<p>Boys have the same family name as their fathers. Girls also use their father's family name, but with one difference. An <i>a</i> is put on the end of the name. Take, for example, a man with the family name <i>Romanov</i>. His son's family name is <i>Romanov</i>. His daughter's family name is <i>Romanova</i>. </p>
<p>Another example: A man's name is <i>Nikolai Alexandrovich Romanov</i>. He has a son named <i>Aleksei</i> and a daughter named <i>Anastasia</i>. 
The son's full name is <i>Aleksei Nikolaevich Romanov</i>. 
The daughter's full name is <i>Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova</i>.</p>
<p>There are also many people in <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> with family names that are not Russian. Some of these names have only one form. That means the family name is the same for sons and daughters. Some examples are Glushko (a <a href="/Ukrainian_language" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian</a> name), Rubinstein (a <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a>/<a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> name) or Shevardnadze (a <a href="/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> name).</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Case">Case</span></h3>

<p>Like <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, and <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a>, Russian has a <a href="/Case_(grammar)" title="Case (grammar)">case system</a>. In Russian the case system applies to <a href="/Nouns" title="Nouns">nouns</a>, <a href="/Pronoun" title="Pronoun">pronouns</a>, <a href="/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjectives</a>,  <a href="/Numeral" title="Numeral">numerals</a> and <a href="/Participle" title="Participle">participles</a>. The case system is a set of word endings (sounds/letters attached to the ends of words) that show the grammatical roles of words in a sentence. Because the grammatical roles are shown by the endings, the order of words in a sentence is more free in Russian than, for example, in English. There are six cases in Russian. The nominative case, which is the form listed in the dictionary, is used for the <a href="/Subject_(grammar)" title="Subject (grammar)">subject</a> of the sentence. The <a href="/Genitive" title="Genitive">genitive</a> case often shows ownership. The <a href="/Accusative" title="Accusative">accusative</a> case is used for a direct object, the <a href="/Dative" title="Dative">dative</a> case for an indirect object. The <a href="/Instrumental" title="Instrumental">instrumental</a> case is used for the tool or instrument with which something is done. The <a href="/Prepositional" title="Prepositional">prepositional</a> case is used after certain prepositions, such as "in" and "on", but other prepositions may require the use of other cases. Each of the cases has other uses besides the basic ones just listed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gender_and_Number">Gender and Number</span></h3>

<p>In Russian, nouns have one of three genders: masculine, feminine, or neuter. Masculine nouns usually end in consonants, neuter nouns usually end in -o or -e, and feminine nouns usually end in -a or -я. There is also the plural, which acts much like a fourth gender - when a word is made into the plural, its gender does not matter as far as the case system is concerned.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adjectives">Adjectives</span></h3>

<p>In Russian, an adjective (a describing word) must agree with the word it describes in gender and number. In the nominative case, adjectives that describe feminine words usually end in -ая or -яя. Ones that describe masculine words usually end in -ый, -ий or -ой. Ones that describe neuter words usually end in -ое or -ее. Ones that describe plural words usually end in -ые or -ие. These endings change depending on the case.</p>
