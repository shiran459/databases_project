<b>Kenya</b> is a <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a> in East <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, about half way down, near the horn of Africa. It has the <a href="/Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> to its east and <a href="/Lake_Victoria" title="Lake Victoria">Lake Victoria</a> to its west.

<p>The first humans may have lived near the lakes of Kenya along the <a href="/Great_Rift_Valley" title="Great Rift Valley">Great Rift Valley</a>, which cuts Kenya from north to south.</p>
<p>Kenya's coast is <a href="/Tropical" title="Tropical">tropical</a> and gets very hot. Inland, it is drier and cooler where the mountains rise up. The highest mountain in Kenya is Mt. Kenya, at {{convert|5,199|m|ft|0}}. <a href="/Mount_Kilimanjaro" title="Mount Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a> crosses over the south border, with <a href="/Tanzania" title="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, but the highest part of Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Many different languages are spoken in Kenya. There are 44 living languages and 1 extinct <a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ethnologue.com/country/KE" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> language that is not spoken any more.

<p>Kenya was a <a href="/Britain" title="Britain">British</a> <a href="/Colony" title="Colony">colony</a>, but became independent on December 12, 1963. For many years, a single <a href="/Party" title="Party">party</a>, the <a href="/Kenya_African_National_Union" title="Kenya African National Union">Kenya African National Union</a> (KANU), ruled Kenya. Kenya has been a democratic country but from 1968 to 1992 it was a single party democracy. General elections were held every 5 years. However, all candidates for election to office had to belong to the ruling party, KANU.  <a href="/Uhuru_Kenyatta" title="Uhuru Kenyatta">Mwai Kibaki</a> is currently the president of Kenya and is the first President of Kenya to belong to a party other than KANU.  Since he became President he has achieved a lot and Kenya has seen economic growth spurts of up 6%.  He however has come under heavy criticism as some feel the reforms that were needed are slow to come.  Many Kenyans living in <a href="/Diaspora" title="Diaspora">Diaspora</a> have begun to return to Kenya, as the promise of the future has created plenty of high-paying jobs that are appealing to foreign-educated Kenyans.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h2>
<p>All Kenyans of school-going age are required to attend Primary <a href="/School" title="School">School</a>.  However, school fees and required uniforms often keep students away from school.  The Kenyan school system consists of 8 years of primary school, standard 1 through 8, 4 years of high school (Form 1 to 4) and 4 years of university but plans are underway of changing the system to 2 years in pre-school, 6 years in primary school,3 years in junior high school,3 years in senior high school and 3 years in university (2-6-6-3) in 2018.  At the end of primary school, all students sit for a standardized exam called Kenya Certificate of Primary <a href="/Education" title="Education">Education</a> (KCPE).  The grades attained in this exam determine which high school the student will attend. In Form 4 (this is the last year in high school), students sit for another exam called Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE).  The highest achieving students are granted admission into the 5 national <a href="/University" title="University">universities</a> (Nairobi, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenyatta University, Egerton University and Moi University). Tertiary colleges, like Globovillee college, also feed the <a href="/Diploma" title="Diploma">diploma</a> graduates to universities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Land_and_animals">Land and animals</span></h2>
<p>Kenya is a country of grassland, but it is not rich, <a href="/Productive" title="Productive">productive</a> land. This is a very dry grassland with poor soil.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[7]</a></sup> Kenya also has very few mineral resources. Three-fourths of the country is covered with plains. They are low in altitude along the coast, but get higher further inland, making a large plateau. The part east of <a href="/Lake_Turkana" title="Lake Turkana">Lake Turkana</a> is the only true desert, but the rest can be very close to desert.</p>
<p>Savannas usually get between 4 and 16 inches (100 to 400 mm) of rain in a year. These lands, however, are called <a href="/Savanna" title="Savanna">savanna</a> because of the type of plants that live there and how they get their rain.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_b"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[7]</a></sup> Savannas have a wet and dry season. During the wet season it can rain hard for long periods of time then not rain at all in the dry season. Savannas that have more rain often have many trees spaced out across their plains. These trees have deep roots or store water, like desert plants do, to live through the long, dry seasons without rain. Even drier savannas will have only grass, and that too only in a few clumps. The dry land is very bad for crops, but it is a wonderful place for all kinds of wild animals to gather and stay.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_c"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[7]</a></sup> That is why Kenya has a lot of parks where the animals are kept, and protected from all the hunters. People/tourists come from all over the world to go on photo <a href="/Safari" title="Safari">safaris</a> in Kenya's special <a href="/Wildlife" title="Wildlife">wildlife</a> parks. The people come to Kenya on safari to see animals such as the rhinoceros, giraffe, wildebeest, elephant, cheetah, antelope, and lion. These animals live on the savanna grasslands.</p>
<p>The wild herbivores move as they eat, and they never stay in one spot because there is not enough grass for all of them. People also usually raise cattle on the savanna. These animals are kept in one place and often eat up all the grass there.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_d"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Government">Government</span></h2>
<p>Since the independence of Kenya in 1963, Kenya has usually had a one-party government and has been a member of the <a href="/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">British</a> Commonwealth.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_e"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[7]</a></sup> The people are, like the Congo, divided into many tribes that often fight. However, Kenya's government is trying to get the people to work together and has encouraged them to run businesses and <a href="/Factory" title="Factory">factories</a>. Kenya is a developing country, slowly growing more modern.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_f"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
