<p><b>Dutton Speedwords</b> is a <a href="/Constructed_language" title="Constructed language">made-up language</a> written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton. The <a href="/Idea" title="Idea">idea</a> of <b>Dutton Speedwords</b> is to make frequent words short, and very frequent words very short. <b>Dutton Speedwords</b> can be used as a second language for international communications. Dutton Speedwords is also a <a href="/Shorthand" title="Shorthand">shorthand</a> writing system â€“ this means you can use it to write quickly. </p>
<p>The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton (1886-1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935. It was called <i>International Symbolic Script</i>. A year later, it was called <i>Speedwords</i>. It was changed in 1946 and 1951.</p>
<p>It has two uses; to be a language and to be used for writing quickly. Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons.</p>
<p>The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore. But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working <a href="/Online" title="Online">online</a>. For example, it makes it faster to type an <a href="/Email" title="Email">email</a>.</p>
<p>Another way of writing quickly is <a href="/Pitman's_shorthand" title="Pitman's shorthand">Pitman's shorthand</a>. This uses special symbols instead of letters. Speedwords uses Roman letters. This makes it easier to learn. It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard. Each word means only one thing. This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word.</p>
<p>The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages. The words are like short versions of the writer's own language.</p>
