The <b>phases of the Moon</b> are the different ways the <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> looks from <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> over about a <a href="/Month" title="Month">month</a>.</p>
<p>As the Moon orbits around the Earth, the half of the Moon that faces the Sun will be lit up. The different shapes of the lit portion of the Moon that can be seen from Earth are known as phases of the Moon. Each phase repeats itself every 29.5 days.</p>
<p>The same half of the Moon always faces the Earth, so the phases will always occur over the same half of the Moon's surface.</p>

<p>
There are 8 phases that the moon goes through.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>new moon</i> is when the Moon cannot be seen because we are looking at the unlit half of the Moon. The <i>new moon</i> phase occurs when the Moon is directly between the Earth and Sun. A <a href="/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> can only happen at new moon.</li>
<li>A <i>waxing crescent moon</i> is when the Moon looks like crescent and the crescent increases ("waxes") in size from one day to the next. This phase usually is only seen in the west.</li>
<li>The <i>first quarter moon</i> (or a <i>half moon</i>) is when half of the lit portion of the Moon is visible after the <i>waxing crescent</i> phase.</li>
<li>A <i>waxing gibbous moon</i> occurs when more than half of the lit portion of the Moon can be seen and the shape increases ("waxes") in size from one day to the next. The <i>waxing gibbous</i> phase occurs between the first quarter and full moon phases. </li>
<li>A <i>full moon</i> is when we can see the entire lit portion of the Moon. The <i>full moon</i> phase occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, called <a href="/Opposition_(astronomy_and_astrology)" title="Opposition (astronomy and astrology)">opposition</a>. A <a href="/Lunar_eclipse" title="Lunar eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> can only happen at full moon.</li>
<li>A <i>waning gibbous moon</i> occurs when more than half of the lit portion of the Moon can be seen and the shape decreases ("wanes") in size from one day to the next. The <i>waning gibbous</i> phase occurs between the full moon and third quarter phases. </li>
<li>The <i>last quarter moon</i> (or a <i>half moon</i>) is when half of the lit portion of the Moon is visible after the <i>waning gibbous</i> phase.</li>
<li>A <i>waning crescent moon</i> is when the Moon looks like the crescent and the crescent decreases ("wanes") in size from one day to the next.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Blue_moon.22">"Blue moon"</span></h2>

<ul>
<li>A second full moon in one calendar month is usually called a "blue moon" and this occurs approximately every 3 years. The saying "Once in a blue moon" refers to something that does not happen often (like a <a href="/Blue" title="Blue">blue</a> moon.)<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-SkyTel"><a href="#_note-SkyTel" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
