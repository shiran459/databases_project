<p>Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the <a href="/Salsa" title="Salsa">Salsa</a> and <a href="/Mambo_(rhythm)" title="Mambo (rhythm)">Mambo</a>. Because Cubans have ancestors from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different.</p>
<p>Reading is very popular in Cuba. Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country, even though the government does not approve of this.

<p>
Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards, three tribes lived on the island. They were the Taínos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Taínos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Taínos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, <a href="/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them.</p>
<p>The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>. In the early 1800s, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent <a href="/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a> in <a href="/1902" title="1902">1902</a>. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the <a href="/Platt_Amendment" title="Platt Amendment">Platt Amendment</a>. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba’s businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cuban_Revolution">Cuban Revolution</span></h3>
<p>In 1959, <a href="/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> led a revolution against <a href="/Fulgencio_Batista" title="Fulgencio Batista">Fulgencio Batista</a>. Castro took power in Cuba with <a href="/Che_Guevara" title="Che Guevara">Che Guevara</a> from <a href="/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba. He ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans went to America because of this. In 1961, the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and try to remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the <i><a href="/Cuban_Missile_Crisis" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a></i>. The Soviet Union removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking Cuba and to remove missiles from Turkey.</p>
<p>Cuba became a <a href="/Communist" title="Communist">communist</a>-led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba’s sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba’s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world. The army fought in <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries.</p>
<p>However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to the United States. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as “The Special Period”. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island.</p>
<p>In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though <a href="/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro was one of the longest-serving heads of state. In 2008, <a href="/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro" title="Raúl Castro">Raúl Castro</a> became the official president of Cuba.</p>
<p>In April 2015, historic talks took place with US <a href="/President_Obama" title="President Obama">President Obama</a> and Cuban <a href="/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro" title="Raúl Castro">General Secretary Raúl Castro</a> in improving relations between the two nations.</p>
<p>The trade embargo issued by <a href="/John_F_Kennedy" title="John F Kennedy">President Kennedy</a> in the 1960s has been considerably loosened under Obama's administration. US citizens can now travel directly to Cuba at certain times of the year. Before, Americans had to go via <a href="/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> if they wanted to go to Cuba. Americans are still not allowed to purchase or smoke <a href="/Cuban_cigars" title="Cuban cigars">Cuban cigars</a>. The cigars are smuggled over the US-Canadian border since they are legal in <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>
<p>For military service, men from the age of 17 to 28 years old must go into the army for two years.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-factbook_c"><a href="#_note-factbook" title="">[3]</a></sup> It is optional for women.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Demographics">Demographics</span></h2>
<p>The population of Cuba is close to 13 million. The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children (in the <a href="/Barracoon" title="Barracoon">barracoon</a>) as <a href="/New_World" title="New World">New World</a> slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/European_people" title="European people">European</a> Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, but the most numerous were the <a href="/Canary_Islands" title="Canary Islands">Canary Islanders</a>, <a href="/Andalusia" title="Andalusia">Andalusians</a>, and Catalans. There was as well some <a href="/France" title="France">French</a>, <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> and <a href="/England" title="England">English</a> peoples. Whites makeup approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the west part of Cuba, specially cities like <a href="/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a> and <a href="/Pinar_de_Rio_Providence" title="Pinar de Rio Providence">Pinar del Rio</a>. These brought with them their language, religions, music and others.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africans</a> and <a href="/Mulatto" title="Mulatto">Mulatto</a> Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000 <a href="/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haitians</a> that came to Cuba during the <a href="/Haitian_Revolution" title="Haitian Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a> days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the <a href="/Kongo" title="Kongo">Kongo</a> and <a href="/Yoruba" title="Yoruba">Yoruba</a> tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others. <a href="/Afro-Cuban" title="Afro-Cuban">Afro-Cubans</a> range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, reigion (<a href="/Santeria" title="Santeria">Santeria</a>), and customs to the Cuban culture.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><a href="/Mediterranean_Sea" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> Cubans are about 3% of the population, however; one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of <a href="/Moor" title="Moor">Moor</a> blood in their family lines; due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like <a href="/Guantanamo_Bay" title="Guantanamo Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a>. They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few vocabularies.</li>

<p>
Cuba is the largest island in the <a href="/West_Indies" title="West Indies">West Indies</a>. It has many resources. Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills. Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle. Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops.</p>
<p>Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba, and they may get it from the <a href="/Sugar_cane" title="Sugar cane">sugar cane</a>. Sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in Cuba, and it brings in most of the money. After that, the second is <a href="/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>.

A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_b"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[8]</a></sup> Other important crops are <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a>, <a href="/Coffee" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, and <a href="/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruit</a>.

<p>Cuba has a semi-tropical climate. That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot, despite its being in the tropiocal zone. Cuba has a wet season and a dry season. The dry season is from November to April, and the wet season is from May to October. August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean.
