<p><b>Creativity</b> is the <a href="/Ability" title="Ability">ability</a> of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable, or the <a href="/Process" title="Process">process</a> of making something new and useful or valuable. It happens in all areas of life - science, art, literature and music. As a personal ability it is very difficult to <a href="/Measure" title="Measure">measure</a>. The reason is that we don't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others. Judging what is creative is also controversial. Some people say only things which are historically new are creative, while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them, then it is also creativity.</p>
<p>Some think creativity is an important thing that makes <a href="/Human" title="Human">humans</a> different from <a href="/Ape" title="Ape">apes</a>. Others recognize that even apes, other <a href="/Primate" title="Primate">primates</a>, other <a href="/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a> and some birds <a href="/Adapt" title="Adapt">adapt</a> to <a href="/Survive" title="Survive">survive</a> by being creative (for example - primates using tools). <a href="/Liane_Gabora" title="Liane Gabora">Liane Gabora</a> believes that all <a href="/Culture" title="Culture">culture</a> comes from creativity, not <a href="/Imitation" title="Imitation">imitation</a>. Therefore, these people say, <a href="/Human_science" title="Human science">human science</a> should focus on it (pay special attention to it): <a href="/Ethics" title="Ethics">Ethics</a> for example would focus on finding creative <a href="/Solution" title="Solution">solutions</a> to <a href="/Ethical_dilemma" title="Ethical dilemma">ethical dilemmas</a>. <a href="/Politics" title="Politics">Politics</a> would focus on the <a href="/Political_virtues" title="Political virtues">political virtues</a> that need some creativity. Imitation would not be the focus of <a href="/Education" title="Education">education</a>. <a href="/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">Linguistics</a> might be more interested in how new words are created by culture, rather than in how existing ones are used in <a href="/Grammar" title="Grammar">grammar</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/Intellectual_interests" title="Intellectual interests">Intellectual interests</a> (recognized as <a href="/Intellectual_rights" title="Intellectual rights">intellectual rights</a> or <a href="/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> in the <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a>) are a way to <a href="/Reward" title="Reward">reward</a> creativity in law, but they do not always work very well. A good example is <a href="/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> which is supposed to pay <a href="/Author" title="Author">authors</a> and <a href="/Artist" title="Artist">artists</a>, but may only pay <a href="/Lawyer" title="Lawyer">lawyers</a> to make (imitative) arguments in <a href="/Court" title="Court">court</a>.</p>
<p>Creativity is a central question in <a href="/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, where it is known as <b>ingenuity</b> (the ability to come up with new ideas) or <b>individual capital</b> - <a href="/Capacity" title="Capacity">capacities</a> that <a href="/Individual" title="Individual">individuals</a> have, that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already. This is separate from the <a href="/Instructional_capital" title="Instructional capital">instructional capital</a> that might try to <a href="/Capture" title="Capture">capture</a> some of that in a <a href="/Patent" title="Patent">patent</a> or <a href="/Training" title="Training">training</a> system that helps others do what the individual leader or <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/founder">founder</a> of the system can do. In <a href="/Urban_economics" title="Urban economics">urban economics</a> there are various ways to measure creativity - the <a href="/Bohemian_Index" title="Bohemian Index">Bohemian Index</a> and <a href="/Gay_Index" title="Gay Index">Gay Index</a> are two attempts to do this <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accurate">accurately</a> and <a href="/Predict" title="Predict">predict</a> the <a href="/Economic_growth" title="Economic growth">economic growth</a> of <a href="/City" title="City">cities</a> based on creativity.
