<b>Propaganda</b> is a form of communication to distribute information. It is always <a href="/Bias" title="Bias">biased</a>. The information is <a href="/Design" title="Design">designed</a> to make people feel a certain way or to believe a certain thing. The information is often <a href="/Political" title="Political">political</a>. </p>
<p>It is hard to tell whether the information is true or false. Very often, the information is confusing and unfair. Propaganda does tend to make <a href="/Dispute" title="Dispute">disputes</a> last longer, and be more difficult to resolve. It can take the form of <a href="/Poster" title="Poster">posters</a>, <a href="/Television" title="Television">TV</a> advertisements, and <a href="/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a> announcements. </p>
<p>The word 'propaganda' comes from <a href="/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a>. At first, it meant 'ideas to be spread around'. But in the <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">First World War</a>, it came to mean 'political ideas that are supposed to be misleading'.</p>
<p>Propaganda is like <a href="/Advertising" title="Advertising">advertising</a> in some ways. For example, it uses the <a href="/Mass_media" title="Mass media">mass media</a> to spread its ideas. But advertising is usually trying <a href="/Sales" title="Sales">to sell</a> something, whereas propaganda is about ideas. It is often political, and used by states or political parties, not private companies.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>
<p>Propaganda is often used during wars.  There it can be very useful.  Sometimes it keeps the people of a country happy {{ndash}} telling them that their country is fighting well and telling them how important it is that the <a href="/Enemy" title="Enemy">enemy</a> is defeated. Sometimes it tries to make people hate the enemy. The information could tell people that the enemy is <a href="/Evil" title="Evil">evil</a> or make them seem not human. Sometimes a <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> gives propaganda to the enemy {{ndash}} telling them that the war is going badly for them and that they should stop fighting.</p>
<p>When a country is not at war, propaganda can still be used. The government may use propaganda to change what people think about a political situation. A group may try to change the way people act towards an <a href="/Issue_(debate)" title="Issue (debate)">issue</a>.</p>
<p>Propaganda under some countries, like dictatorships, is used along with <a href="/Censorship" title="Censorship">censorship</a>. While propaganda tries to give people false ideas, censorship forces the ones who disagree with propaganda to keep quiet. Then the propaganda can say everything, because nobody can question it in public.</p>
<p>Propaganda is also used to win people by tricking them. Some people say that <a href="/Cult" title="Cult">cults</a> use propaganda to get people to join them.</p>

<li>Propaganda through mass media (<a href="/Print" title="Print">print</a>, <a href="/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a> and <a href="/Film" title="Film">film</a>) was used by the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> from beginning to end. Some great artists, like <a href="/Sergei_Eisenstein" title="Sergei Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a> and <a href="/El_Lissitzky" title="El Lissitzky">El Lissitzky</a>, helped them do it. Many others, such as <a href="/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn" title="Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn">Solzhenitsyn</a>, did not.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Propaganda has been used in every known civilisation. It was used by <a href="/Rameses_II" title="Rameses II">Rameses II</a> on his monuments in <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>; it was used by <a href="/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="/Orator" title="Orator">orators</a>; it was used by <a href="/Julius_Caesar" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, and all <a href="/Roman_Emperor" title="Roman Emperor">Roman Emperors</a>. The word itself is formed from <i>propagate</i>, meaning to multiply.</p>
<p>Propaganda was carried much further  by the <i>Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide</i> of the <a href="/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> This committee, founded in 1622 by <a href="/Pope_Gregory_XV" title="Pope Gregory XV">Pope Gregory XV</a>, had action branches in most <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> countries. These were the local branches of the <a href="/Inquisition" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>, which sought out <a href="/Heretic" title="Heretic">heretics</a>. With <a href="/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a> and the threat of death by burning at the stake, they forced heretics to recant (to publicly withdraw their previous beliefs). The objective was to remove all challenges to the supremacy of the Church in matters of <a href="/Belief" title="Belief">belief</a>. The 1578 handbook for inquisitors noted  "Punishment does not take place primarily and for the correction and good of the person punished, but for the public good in order that others may become terrified and weaned away from the evils they would commit".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
