<p><b>Grammar</b> is the study of words, and  the way they sound, and how they are used in a sentence.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <a href="/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greeks</a> used to call it <i>grammatikē tékhnē</i>, the <a href="/Craft" title="Craft">craft</a> of letters. It can have any of these meanings:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The study of a <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a>: how it works, and everything about it. This is a<i>background research on language</i>.</li>
<li>The study of <a href="/Sentence" title="Sentence">sentence</a> structure. A set of rules and examples to show how the language should be used. This is a <i>correct usage grammar</i>, as in a textbook or manual/guide.</li>
<li>The system which people learn as they grow up. This is the <i>native-speaker's grammar</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-McA"><a href="#_note-McA" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup>p446</sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Crystal"><a href="#_note-Crystal" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup>p453</sup></li>
</ol>

<p>When we speak, we use the native-person's grammar, or as near as we can. When we write, we try to write with correct grammar. So, speaking and writing a language each have their own style.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Different_languages">Different languages</span></h2>
<p>All languages have their own grammar. Most <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> languages are rather similar, but some, such as <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> and <a href="/Japanese_language" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>, are very different from all European languages.</p>
<p>English makes few changes to its word endings ('<a href="/Suffix" title="Suffix">suffixes</a>'). In the <a href="/Italic" title="Italic">Italic</a> or 'Romance' languages (such as <a href="/French_language" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="/Italian_language" title="Italian language">Italian</a>, and <a href="/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>), word endings carry a lot of meaning. In English we have just a few: plurals and possessives (<i>John's</i>) are the most common. In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one: I love, you love, but <i>she love<b>s</b></i>. That final <b>'s</b>' is a remnant of <a href="/Old_English" title="Old English">Anglo-Saxon</a>, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in <a href="/Grammatical_tense" title="Grammatical tense">tense</a>: walk<b>ed</b>, walk<b>ing</b>.</p>
<p><a href="/Word_order" title="Word order">Word order</a> is the other big difference. Romance languages normally put <a href="/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjectives</a> after the <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">nouns</a> to which they refer. For example, in English, a person may say <i>I like fast cars</i>, but in <a href="/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, it is <i>Me gustan los coches rápidos</i>. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a>, verbs often come near the end of sentences (as: <i>Die Katze hat die Nahrung gegessen.</i>), whereas in English we usually put them between <a href="/Subject_(grammar)" title="Subject (grammar)">subject</a> and <a href="/Object_(grammar)" title="Object (grammar)">object</a>, as: <i>the cat has eaten the food</i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Changing_language">Changing language</span></h2>
<p>Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more <a href="/Fluid" title="Fluid">fluid</a>. Sentences which English speakers find normal today, might have seemed strange 100 years ago. And they might not, because many of our favourite sayings come from the <a href="/Authorized_King_James_Version" title="Authorized King James Version">Authorized King James Version</a> of the <a href="/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>, and from <a href="/Shakespeare" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>.</p>
<p>Some people use grammar that is different from other people when speaking. For example, people who use what is called <a href="/General_American_English" title="General American English">General American English</a> or <a href="/Received_Pronunciation" title="Received Pronunciation">BBC English</a> might say, <i>I didn't do anything</i>, while someone who speaks what is called <a href="/African_American_Vernacular_English" title="African American Vernacular English">African American Vernacular English</a> or AAVE might say, <i>I didn't do nothing</i>. <a href="/London" title="London">London</a> <a href="/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> version: <i>I ain't done nuffink!</i> These are called <i>double negatives</i>, and are found almost entirely in spoken English, and seldom written.</p>
<p>These differences are called <a href="/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialects</a>. The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live. Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using 'proper English', they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Nash"><a href="#_note-Nash" title="">[4]</a></sup> The models for <i>spoken</i> English in Britain are often called <a href="/Received_Pronunciation" title="Received Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> or BBC English.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nouns">Nouns</span></h3>
<p>Nouns are 'thing' words like 'table and 'chair'. They are <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/object">objects</a>, things you see in everyday life. Proper nouns are places, people's names, or other things like days of the week. The name 'James' is a proper noun, as is 'Wednesday' and 'London'. Nouns can also be <a href="/Abstract" title="Abstract">abstract</a> things, such as 'suffering' or 'happiness'.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Verbs">Verbs</span></h3>
<p>Verbs describe <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/action">actions</a> and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/state">states</a>. Action: "John threw the ball". State: "I am worried". The basic verb form is called the <a href="/Infinitive" title="Infinitive">infinitive</a>. The infinitive for existence is "to be". A famous example is the speech of <a href="/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>: <i>To be or not to be, that is the question</i>.</p>
<p>Variations of the infinitive create <a href="/Verb#Tense" title="Verb">verb tenses</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adjectives">Adjectives</span></h3>
<p>Adjectives describe nouns. For example, the pretty in "pretty bicycle" says that the bicycle is pretty. In other words, the "pretty" is describing the bicycle. This can also happen with a place. For example, the tall in "that's a tall building" is describing the building.</p>
