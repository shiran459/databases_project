<p>A <b>leg</b> is something used to support things; to hold them up. <a href="/Bird" title="Bird">Birds</a> and <a href="/Human" title="Human">humans</a> have two legs. Some objects, for example <a href="/Table_(furniture)" title="Table (furniture)">tables</a> and <a href="/Chair" title="Chair">chairs</a>, also have legs to hold them up.

Animals normally have 2 or 4 legs (<a href="/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>, which are animals with a <a href="/Backbone" title="Backbone">backbone</a>), or 6, 8, or 12 (<a href="/Arthropod" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a>, for example <a href="/Insect" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="/Spider" title="Spider">spiders</a>). <a href="/Centipede" title="Centipede">Centipedes</a> and <a href="/Millipede" title="Millipede">millipedes</a> have a lot more legs, but not exactly a hundred or a thousand as their names make people who do not know them think. <a href="/Human" title="Human">Humans</a> have 2 legs, complete with <a href="/Feet" title="Feet">feet</a>.</p>
<p><i>Biped</i> is an animal with two legs and <i>quadruped</i> is an animal with four legs.</p>
<p>People also use the word "leg" in <a href="/Idiom" title="Idiom">idioms</a>, for example: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>you do not have a leg to stand on</i> (that means "you have no support; you have no chance in this discussion") </li>
<li><i>to leg it</i> (to run)</li>
<li><i>to pull someone's leg</i> (to play a little joke on someone for fun by trying to make them believe something that is not true)</li>
</ul>
