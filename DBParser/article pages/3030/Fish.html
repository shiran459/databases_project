<p><b>Fish</b> (plural: fish or fishes) are <a href="/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> which live in water and <a href="/Respiration" title="Respiration">respire</a> (get <a href="/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>) with <a href="/Gills" title="Gills">gills</a>. They lack <a href="/Limb" title="Limb">limbs</a> with digits (fingers &amp; toes). This is a <a href="/Definition" title="Definition">definition</a> which does not quite work: some <a href="/Amphibia" title="Amphibia">amphibia</a> also live in water and have external gills, but they are not fishes.  </p>
<p>Fish used to be a <a href="/Class_(biology)" title="Class (biology)">class</a> of <a href="/Vertebrates" title="Vertebrates">vertebrates</a>.  Now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates:

<dd><a href="/Sarcopterygii" title="Sarcopterygii">Lobe-finned fish</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>There are more fish than <a href="/Tetrapods" title="Tetrapods">tetrapods</a> (land vertebrates): there are over 33,000 described species of fish.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Fish are usually covered with scales. They have two sets of paired <a href="/Fins" title="Fins">fins</a> and several unpaired fins. Most fish are cold-blooded (<a href="/Poikilotherm" title="Poikilotherm">poikilotherm</a>). A fish takes in the <a href="/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> from the water using <a href="/Gills" title="Gills">gills</a>. There are many different kinds of fish. They live in <a href="/Fresh_water" title="Fresh water">fresh water</a> in <a href="/Lake" title="Lake">lakes</a> and <a href="/River" title="River">rivers</a>, and in <a href="/Salt_water" title="Salt water">salt water</a> in the <a href="/Ocean" title="Ocean">ocean</a>. Some fish are less than one <a href="/Centimeter" title="Centimeter">centimeter</a> long. The largest fish is the <a href="/Whale_shark" title="Whale shark">whale shark</a>, which can be almost 15 <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">meters</a> long and weigh 15 <a href="/Ton" title="Ton">tons</a>. Most fish live in the water. A group of fish called the <a href="/Lungfish" title="Lungfish">lungfish</a> have developed <a href="/Lung" title="Lung">lungs</a> because they live in rivers and pools which dry up in certain parts of the year. They burrow into mud and <a href="/Aestivation" title="Aestivation">aestivate</a> until the water returns.</p>
<p>'Fish' is a <a href="/Paraphyletic" title="Paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> term in <a href="/Cladistics" title="Cladistics">cladistics</a> because it lacks a <a href="/Monophyletic" title="Monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group of descendants. It does not include the land vertebrates or <a href="/Tetrapod" title="Tetrapod">tetrapods</a>, which descended from fish.</p>

<p>Certain animals that have the word <i>fish</i> in their name are not really fish: <a href="/Crayfish" title="Crayfish">Crayfish</a> are <a href="/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, and <a href="/Jellyfish" title="Jellyfish">jellyfish</a> are <a href="/Cnidaria" title="Cnidaria">Cnidarians</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bony_and_cartilagenous_fish">Bony and cartilagenous fish</span></h3>
<p>Most kinds of fish have <a href="/Bone" title="Bone">bones</a>. Some kinds of fish, such as <a href="/Shark" title="Shark">sharks</a> and <a href="/Ray" title="Ray">rays</a>, do not have real bones (their <a href="/Skeleton" title="Skeleton">skeletons</a> are made of <a href="/Cartilage" title="Cartilage">cartilage</a>) they are known as <a href="/Cartilaginous_fish" title="Cartilaginous fish">cartilaginous fish</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fish_scales">Fish scales</span></h3>
<p>All fish are covered with overlapping <a href="/Scale_(zoology)" title="Scale (zoology)">scales</a>, and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale. Teleosts ('modern' fish) have what are called <i>leptoid</i> scales. These grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles. Sharks and other chondrichthyes have <i>placoid</i> scales made of denticles, like small versions of their teeth. These also overlap in a head to tail direction, producing a tough outer layer. Shark skin is available for purchase as <a href="/Shagreen" title="Shagreen">shagreen</a>, a leather which as original is smooth in one direction, and rough in the other direction. It may be polished for use, but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping.</p>
<p>The scales are usually covered with a layer of <a href="/Slime" title="Slime">slime</a> which improves passage through the water, and makes the fish more slippery to a <a href="/Predator" title="Predator">predator</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Swimming">Swimming</span></h2>
<p>Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water. There are exceptions, but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail, generally getting larger as they go along. Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body &amp; tail fin (caudal fin). However, there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins. The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example. But they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies &amp; caudal fins.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muscle">Muscle</span></h3>
<p>Fish can swim slowly for many hours using red muscle fibres. They also make short, fast bursts using white muscle. The two types of muscle have a fundamentally different <a href="/Physiology" title="Physiology">physiology</a>. The red fibres are usually alongside a much greater number of white fibres.</p>
<p>The white fibres get their energy by converting the <a href="/Carbohydrate" title="Carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> <a href="/Glycogen" title="Glycogen">glycogen</a> to lactate (<a href="/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a>). This is <a href="/Anaerobic_metabolism" title="Anaerobic metabolism">anaerobic metabolism</a>, that is, it does not need <a href="/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>. They are used for fast, short bursts. Once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles, they stop working, and it takes time for the lactate to be removed, and the glycogen replaced.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-McN"><a href="#_note-McN" title="">[10]</a></sup> Using their white fibres, fish can reach speeds of 10 lengths per second for short bursts.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-McN_b"><a href="#_note-McN" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Swimming for long periods needs oxygen for the red fibres. The oxygen supply has to be constant because these fibres only operate <a href="/Aerobic" title="Aerobic">aerobically</a>. They are red because they have a rich blood supply, and they contain <a href="/Myoglobin" title="Myoglobin">myoglobin</a>. Myoglobin transports the oxygen to the oxidising systems. Red muscle gets its energy by oxidising <a href="/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a>, which weight for weight has twice as much energy as carbohydrate or protein.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-McN_c"><a href="#_note-McN" title="">[10]</a></sup> Using their red fibres, fish can keep up a speed of 3{{ndash}}5 lengths per second for long periods.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-McN_d"><a href="#_note-McN" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Swimming_in_groups">Swimming in groups</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Shoaling and schooling}}
Many fish swim in groups.  Schools of fish can swim together for long distances, and may be chased by predators which also swim in schools. Casual groups are called 'shoals'.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Body_shape">Body shape</span></h2>
<p>The shape of the body of a fish is important to its swimming. This is because <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/streamline">streamlined</a> body shapes makes the water drag less. Here are some common fish shapes.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Streamlining">Streamlining</span></h3>


<p>The picture on the right shows a <a href="/Shark" title="Shark">shark</a>. This shark's shape is called <i>fusiform</i>, and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy. This is the best shape for going through water quickly.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly. Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly, like <a href="/Marlin" title="Marlin">marlins</a>, <a href="/Swordfish" title="Swordfish">swordfish</a>, and <a href="/Tuna" title="Tuna">tuna</a>. <a href="/Ichthyosaur" title="Ichthyosaur">Ichthyosaurs</a>, <a href="/Porpoise" title="Porpoise">porpoises</a>, <a href="/Dolphin" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a>, <a href="/Killer_whale" title="Killer whale">killer whales</a> all have similar shapes. This is an example of <a href="/Convergent_evolution" title="Convergent evolution">convergent evolution</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eel-like">Eel-like</span></h3>
<p>The long, ribbon-like shape of an <a href="/Eel" title="Eel">eel</a>'s body shows another shape.  This enables them to hide in cracks, springing out quickly to capture prey, then returning quickly to their hiding spot.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flatfish">Flatfish</span></h3>


<p>
<a href="/Flatfish" title="Flatfish">Flatfish</a> live on the bottom of the ocean or lake. Most use <a href="/Camouflage" title="Camouflage">camouflage</a>: they change colors to match the ocean floor.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Compressed">Compressed</span></h3>
<p>Fish with compressed shapes have flat, vertical bodies, with one eye on each side. They swim upright and can be very thin. They usually live in <a href="/Reef" title="Reef">reefs</a> where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the <a href="/Coral" title="Coral">corals</a>, <a href="/Sponge" title="Sponge">sponges</a>, and rocks, keeping hidden from predators. <a href="/Marine_angelfish" title="Marine angelfish">Angelfish</a>, <a href="/Surgeonfish" title="Surgeonfish">surgeonfish</a>, and <a href="/Butterflyfish" title="Butterflyfish">butterflyfish</a> are all compressed fish.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fish_as_food">Fish as food</span></h2>
<p>People eat many kinds of fish.  The fish that people eat most include <a href="/Carp" title="Carp">carp</a>, <a href="/Cod" title="Cod">cod</a>, <a href="/Herring" title="Herring">herring</a>, <a href="/Perch" title="Perch">perch</a>, <a href="/Sardine" title="Sardine">sardines</a>, <a href="/Sturgeon" title="Sturgeon">sturgeon</a>, <a href="/Tilapia" title="Tilapia">tilapia</a>, <a href="/Trout" title="Trout">trout</a>, <a href="/Tuna" title="Tuna">tuna</a>, and many others.  A person who buys and sells fish for eating is called a <a href="/Fishmonger" title="Fishmonger">fishmonger</a>.</p>
<p>The word <i>to fish</i> is also used for the activity of catching fish.  People catch fish with small <a href="/Fishing_net" title="Fishing net">nets</a> from the side of the water or from small <a href="/Boat" title="Boat">boats</a>, or with big <a href="/Fishing_net" title="Fishing net">nets</a> from big boats.  People can also catch fish with <a href="/Fishing_pole" title="Fishing pole">fishing poles</a> and fishhooks with <a href="/Bait" title="Bait">bait</a>.  This is often called <a href="/Angling" title="Angling">angling</a>.  Anglers also different types of <a href="/Fishing_lure" title="Fishing lure">fishing lures</a>.  </p>
