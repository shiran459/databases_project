<p>A <b>diesel-electric</b> <a href="/Engine" title="Engine">engine</a> is a <a href="/Diesel_generator" title="Diesel generator">diesel generator</a>, a <a href="/Diesel_engine" title="Diesel engine">diesel engine</a> that drives an electric <a href="/Generator" title="Generator">generator</a>. The generator feeds <a href="/Electric_power" title="Electric power">electric power</a> to an <a href="/Electric_motor" title="Electric motor">electric motor</a> which turns a <a href="/Driveshaft" title="Driveshaft">driveshaft</a>.  Its <a href="/Efficiency" title="Efficiency">efficiency</a> is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through <a href="/Gear" title="Gear">gears</a>.  Most <a href="/Locomotive" title="Locomotive">locomotives</a> and many <a href="/Ship" title="Ship">ships</a> use diesel-electric drive.</p>
<p>Many diesel-electric drives, especially small ones, store the electricity in a <a href="/Battery" title="Battery">battery</a>. Some designs also store <a href="/Braking_energy" title="Braking energy">braking energy</a> in a <a href="/Flywheel" title="Flywheel">flywheel</a>, which can also charge a battery. However, these add even more <a href="/Complexity" title="Complexity">complexity</a> and weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for <a href="/City_driving" title="City driving">city driving</a> where <a href="/Service_station" title="Service station">service stations</a> are always available and there is much <a href="/Stop_and_go_driving" title="Stop and go driving">stop and go driving</a>.</p>
<p>Because they do not require any change or <a href="/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> in stations nor much in <a href="/Vehicle_design" title="Vehicle design">vehicle design</a>, diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today's <a href="/Internal_combustion_engine" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a>. When properly tuned, they have low <a href="/Toxic" title="Toxic">emissions</a> and they use only about one-third of the <a href="/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> of most <a href="/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> engines powering similar vehicles.</p>
<p><a href="/Honda" title="Honda">Honda</a> and <a href="/Toyota" title="Toyota">Toyota</a> are presently delivering consumer priced diesel-electric cars. By contrast, <a href="/Hydrogen_infrastructure" title="Hydrogen infrastructure">hydrogen infrastructure</a> is thought to be decades off, and is not fully implemented even in <a href="/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> where there is abundant free <a href="/Geothermal_electricity" title="Geothermal electricity">geothermal electricity</a>.</p>
<p>Many <a href="/Activist" title="Activist">activists</a> feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall, a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel-electric vehicles in the nearer term.</p>
