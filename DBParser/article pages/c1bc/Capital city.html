<p>A <b>capital city</b> (or <b>capital town</b> or just <b>capital</b>) is a <a href="/City" title="City">city</a> or <a href="/Town" title="Town">town</a>, specified by <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a> or <a href="/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a>, by the <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> of a <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a>, or part of a country, such as a <a href="/State" title="State">state</a>, <a href="/Province" title="Province">province</a> or <a href="/County" title="County">county</a>. It usually serves as the location of the government's central <a href="/Meeting" title="Meeting">meeting</a> place and <a href="/Office" title="Office">offices</a>. Most of the country's <a href="/Leader" title="Leader">leaders</a> and <a href="/Official" title="Official">officials</a> work in the capital city.</p>

<p>Capitals are usually among the largest cities in their regions. For example, <a href="/Montevideo" title="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> is <a href="/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>'s capital as well as its biggest city. If a capital city is much bigger than a nation's second city, like <a href="/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> in <a href="/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, it can be considered a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primate_city">primate city</a>.</p>
<p>However, a capital is not always the largest city in a country. For example, the capital of the <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> is <a href="/New_Delhi" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>, which is smaller than <a href="/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, the largest city; and the capital of <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> is <a href="/Islamabad" title="Islamabad">Islamabad</a>, which is smaller than <a href="/Karachi" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>. Also, in countries with subdivisions like the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the capital cities or towns of the federated states are often not the largest or most populated town. For example, <a href="/Albany%2C_New_York" title="Albany, New York">Albany</a> is capital of <a href="/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, not <a href="/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>.</p>
<p>An unusual case exists in <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>; the federal capital, <a href="/Ottawa" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, is not the largest city in its province, <a href="/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, which is <a href="/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. But Toronto happens to be the capital of the province of Ontario. This way, Toronto is both a capital and a non-capital, depending on how you see it, as a city in a country or part of it.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Number">Number</span></h2>
<p>Some countries have more than one capital, often for different purposes, like <a href="/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, which has two (Sucre and <a href="/La_Paz" title="La Paz">La Paz</a>); and <a href="/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, which has three (<a href="/Pretoria" title="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, <a href="/Cape_Town" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>, and <a href="/Bloemfontein" title="Bloemfontein">Bloemfontein</a>). Some countries treat their capitals as if it was the country itself, like <a href="/Monaco" title="Monaco">Monaco</a>, the <a href="/Vatican_City" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a>, and <a href="/City-state" title="City-state">city-states</a> like <a href="/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>.</p>
<p>Not all countries have capitals. <a href="/Nauru" title="Nauru">Nauru</a> is a country that does not officially have a capital, but the district of <a href="/Yaren" title="Yaren">Yaren</a>, which is where the government is, can be called the <i><a href="/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> capital. Also, although many people consider the city of <a href="/Bern" title="Bern">Bern</a> in <a href="/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> to be the capital of the country, it is in fact not the case by law, but has the status of "<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_city">federal city</a>" by the government which is based there.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Location">Location</span></h2>
<p>Capitals can be in cities that are already there like <a href="/London" title="London">London</a> or <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, or new cities can be built and made the capital like <a href="/Canberra" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> and <a href="/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. Countries can change capitals from time to time. Several cities have been the capital of <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>. The <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> once had its capital in <a href="/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and later in <a href="/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> but moved to the new city of <a href="/Washington%2C_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in 1800. <a href="/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> was the capital of <a href="/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, until the new city of <a href="/Brasilia" title="Brasilia">Brasilia</a> was built between 1956 and 1960.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Seat_of_government">Seat of government</span></h2>
<p>Most countries have their seat of government within their capital city, though some do not. <a href="/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> has their capital at <a href="/Kuala_Lumpur" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> but their seat of government is at <a href="/Putrajaya" title="Putrajaya">Putrajaya</a>. In the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the <a href="/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a> says that <a href="/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> is the <i><a href="/De_jure" title="De jure">de jure</a></i> capital, but the government is in <a href="/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>.</p>
