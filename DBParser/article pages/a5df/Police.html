<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Powers">Powers</span></h2>
<p>The police have different powers to help them do their <a href="/Job" title="Job">job</a>. These powers are different in different <a href="/Country" title="Country">countries</a>. Most police officers have the power to <a href="/Arrest" title="Arrest">arrest</a> people, search people, and search <a href="/House" title="House">houses</a>/properties. They sometimes carry <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equipment">equipment</a> such as <a href="/Gun" title="Gun">guns</a>, <a href="/Baton" title="Baton">batons</a>, <a href="/Taser" title="Taser">tasers</a>, or <a href="/Pepper_spray" title="Pepper spray">pepper spray</a>. The area where police officers can use these powers is called their <a href="/Jurisdiction" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>. If officers are outside of their jurisdiction, another police force with jurisdiction can then use their powers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Duties">Duties</span></h2>
<p>The police deal with;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Stopping crime and protecting the public. They do this by <a href="/Patrol" title="Patrol">patrolling</a> on foot in <a href="/Uniform" title="Uniform">uniform</a> and in police cars. This can stop some forms of <a href="/Crime" title="Crime">criminal behavior</a>.</li>
<li>Investigating crime.  This means that the police find out who did the crime. Some crimes, such as <a href="/Robbery" title="Robbery">robbery</a> or <a href="/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a> are investigated by <a href="/Detective" title="Detective">detectives</a>.</li>
<li>To help in emergencies or problems that are not crimes. This may be car accidents, fires, or people who are sick or hurt. The police work with <a href="/Firefighter" title="Firefighter">firefighters</a>, <a href="/Ambulance" title="Ambulance">ambulances</a>, and rescuers. They might direct <a href="/Traffic" title="Traffic">traffic</a>, help lost children, or give traffic <a href="/Citation" title="Citation">tickets</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Parts_of_police_departments">Parts of police departments</span></h2>
<p>Most police departments have officers in two main groups: a "patrol" group with officers who wear uniforms, and a "detective" group with officers who wear normal clothing. </p>

<ul>
<li>Patrol officers travel through their area. They may travel by foot, on bicycle or motorcyle, or in marked cars. The cars have warning lights and sirens that can be used. The sirens make a loud sound. Patrol officers enforce <a href="/Motor_vehicle" title="Motor vehicle">motor vehicle</a> and <a href="/Crime" title="Crime">criminal</a> laws. In some locations patrol officers manage the local <a href="/Jail" title="Jail">jail</a>.</li>
<li>Detectives work on <a href="/Investigation" title="Investigation">investigations</a> that are more complex. They try to find <a href="/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a>, <a href="/Illegal_drug" title="Illegal drug">illegal drugs</a>, and <a href="/Sexual_intercourse" title="Sexual intercourse">sex</a> crimes like <a href="/Prostitution" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a>, <a href="/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>, and <a href="/Rape" title="Rape">rape</a>. Prostitution is not a crime in all countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all countries use the same words to describe these groups. In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, for example, patrol officers form the "uniform branch", while detectives work within the CID ("Criminal Investigation Department"). </p>
<p>Police uniforms, equipment and methods vary depending on the country. In some places, groups of police train for special jobs such as dealing with <a href="/Riot" title="Riot">riots</a> or dealing with highly dangerous criminals. </p>
