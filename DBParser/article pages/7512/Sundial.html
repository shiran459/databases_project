A <b>sundial</b> shows the current <a href="/Solar_time" title="Solar time">solar time</a> during the day. It does this because the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">sun</a> appears to move through the sky. At different times in the day when the sun is shining, a <a href="/Shadow" title="Shadow">shadow</a> is cast in different places on the dial. A person marks the dial with the time at a certain shadow. This lets users easily see the time. There are a few commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow. </p>
<p>Ancient <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> had sundials. Other <a href="/Culture" title="Culture">cultures</a> developed them further, including the <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> and <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>.</p>
