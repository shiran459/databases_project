<p><b>Mythology</b> refers variously to the collected <b>myths</b> of a group of <a href="/People" title="People">people</a> or to the study of such myths{{mdash}}their body of <a href="/Narrative" title="Narrative">stories</a> which they tell to explain nature, <a href="/History" title="History">history</a>, and <a href="/Custom" title="Custom">customs</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> It can also refer to the study of such myths.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Kirk"><a href="#_note-Kirk" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <b>myth</b> is a <a href="/Story" title="Story">story</a> which is not true. The <a class="external text" href="http://mythscan.com/myth-definition-true-or-false/" rel="nofollow">definition</a> of the word myth is still subject to debate. Myths may be very old, or new (for example: urban myths). There may not be <a href="/Record" title="Record">records</a> or other <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proof">proof</a> that they happened, but at least some parts of myths may be true. We know about them from older people telling them to younger people. Some myths may have started as 'true' stories but as people told and re-told them, they may have changed some parts, so they are less 'true'. They may have changed them by mistake, or to make them more interesting. All cultures have myths. Stories about the <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> <a href="/Deity" title="Deity">gods</a> and goddesses are myths.</p>
<p>Many people once believed in <a href="/Legendary_creature" title="Legendary creature">legendary creatures</a> and gods. These <a href="/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a> or gods may have control or has power over a part of human or natural life. For example, the <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greek</a> god <a href="/Zeus" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> had powers over lightning and storms. Whenever Zeus wanted to, he could make a storm, and he made storms to show his anger.

<p>All cultures have developed their own mythology over time. Mythology includes the <a href="/Legend" title="Legend">legends</a> of their history, their religions, their stories of how the world was created, and their heroes. These stories have great symbolic power, and this may be a major reason why they survive as long as they do, sometimes for thousands of years.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historians.27_views_on_myths">Historians' views on myths</span></h2>
<p>Although myths are often considered to be stories of events that have not happened, many historians think myths are about actual events that have become connected with strong symbolic meaning, or that have been changed, or shifted in time or place, or even reversed. One way of thinking about this process is to imagine 'myths' as lying at the far end of an imaginary line. At one end of the line is 'dispassionate account', and 'legendary occurrence' or 'mythical status' is near the other end. As an event progresses toward the 'mythical' end of this line or continuum, the way people think, feel and say about the event changes. It may gain greater historical significance while the 'facts' become less important. By the time one arrives at the mythical end of the line, the story has "taken on a life of its own" and the facts of the original event have become almost unimportant.</p>
