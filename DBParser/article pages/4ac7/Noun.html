A <b>noun</b> is a kind of <a href="/Word" title="Word">word</a> (see <a href="/Part_of_speech" title="Part of speech">part of speech</a>) that is usually the <a href="/Name" title="Name">name</a> of something such as a <a href="/Person" title="Person">person</a>, <a href="/Place" title="Place">place</a>, <a href="/Thing" title="Thing">thing</a>, <a href="/Quality" title="Quality">quality</a>, or <a href="/Idea" title="Idea">idea</a>. In <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a>, nouns can be <a href="/Singular" title="Singular">singular</a> or <a href="/Plural" title="Plural">plural</a>.</p>
<p>Nouns often need a word called an <a href="/Article_(grammar)" title="Article (grammar)">article</a> or <a href="/Determiner" title="Determiner">determiner</a> (like <i>the</i> or <i>that</i>). These words usually do not go with other kinds of words like <a href="/Verb" title="Verb">verbs</a> or <a href="/Adverb" title="Adverb">adverbs</a>. (For example, people do not also describe nouns). In English, there are more nouns than any other kind of word.</p>
<p>Every language in the world has nouns, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages, nouns do not change for singular and plural, and sometimes there is no word for <i>the</i>.</p>
<p>Some examples of nouns in English are: <i>time, people, way, year, government, day, world, life, work, part, number, house, system, company, end, party, information</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_history_of_the_word_noun">The history of the word <i>noun</i></span></h2>
<p>The word 'noun' comes from the <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>nomen</i> meaning "<a href="/Name" title="Name">name</a>." Words like nouns were described in early days by the <a href="/Sanskrit" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> grammarian <a href="/Panini_(grammarian)" title="Panini (grammarian)">Pāṇini</a> and ancient Greeks like <a href="/Dionysios_Thrax" title="Dionysios Thrax">Dionysios Thrax</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses_of_nouns">Uses of nouns</span></h2>
<p>In English <a href="/Sentence" title="Sentence">sentences</a>, nouns can be used as a <a href="/Subject" title="Subject">subject</a>, <a href="/Object_(grammar)" title="Object (grammar)">object</a>, or <a href="/Complement" title="Complement">complement</a>. They often come after <a href="/Preposition" title="Preposition">prepositions</a>, as the 'object of preposition'.</p>
<p>Nouns can sometimes describe other nouns (such as a <b>soccer</b> ball). When they do this, they are called <a href="/Modifier" title="Modifier">modifiers</a> or adjuncts.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="/Verb" title="Verb">verb</a> forms that can be used in the same way as nouns (such as 'I like <i>running</i>.)  These are called <i>verbals</i> or <i>verbal nouns</i>, and include <i><a href="/Participle" title="Participle">participles</a></i> (which can also be adjectives) and <i><a href="/Infinitive" title="Infinitive">infinitives</a></i>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_nouns_and_how_they_are_ordered">Kinds of nouns and how they are ordered</span></h2>
<p>Nouns are ordered into <b>common nouns</b>, and <b>proper nouns</b>. There are also <a href="/Pronoun" title="Pronoun">pronouns</a>. These have commonly been considered a different part of speech from nouns, but in the past some grammars have included them as nouns<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> as do many modern <a href="/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguists</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Proper_nouns">Proper nouns</span></h3>
<p>A <b>proper noun</b> (also called <b>proper name</b>) is a name given to individual people, places, companies, or brands. Some examples of proper nouns are: <i>London, John, God, October, Mozart, Saturday, Coke, Mr. Brown, Atlantic Ocean</i></p>
<p>Proper nouns begin with an <a href="/Upper_case" title="Upper case">upper case</a> (<a href="/Majuscule" title="Majuscule">capital</a>) letter in <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> and many other languages that use the <a href="/Roman_alphabet" title="Roman alphabet">Roman alphabet</a>.  (However, in <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a>, all nouns begin with an upper case letter.) The word "I" is really a pronoun, although it is capitalized in English, like a proper noun.</p>
<p>Some common nouns (see below) can also be used as proper nouns. For example, someone might be named 'Tiger Smith' -- even though he is not a <a href="/Tiger" title="Tiger">tiger</a> or a <a href="/Smith" title="Smith">smith</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_nouns">Common nouns</span></h3>
<p><b>Common nouns</b> are all other nouns that are not proper nouns. Sometimes the same word can be either a common noun or a proper noun, depending on how it is used; for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>there can be many <i><a href="/Gods" title="Gods">gods</a></i>, but there is only one <i><a href="/God" title="God">God</a></i>.</li>
<li>there can be many <i>internets</i> (two or more networks connected together), but the largest internet in the world is the <i><a href="/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a></i>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Number_and_countability">Number and countability</span></h2>
<p>In English and many other languages, nouns have 'number'. But some nouns are only <a href="/Singular" title="Singular">singular</a> (such as <i>furniture, physics</i>) and others are only <a href="/Plural" title="Plural">plural</a> (such as <i>clothes, police</i>). Also, some nouns are 'countable' (they can be counted, for example, <i>one piece, two pieces</i>) but others are not (for example, we do not say <i>one furniture, two furnitures</i>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Possessives">Possessives</span></h2>
<p>Nouns are words for things, and since things can be possessed, nouns can also change to show possession in grammar. In English, we usually add an <a href="/Apostrophe" title="Apostrophe">apostrophe</a> and an <i>s</i> to nouns to make them <i>possessive</i>, or sometimes just an apostrophe when there is already an <i>s</i> at the end, like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>This is Sam. This is <b>Sam's</b> cat.</li>
<li>The <b>woman's</b> hair is long.</li>
<li>There are three cats. The <b>cats</b>' mother is sleeping.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_adjectives_become_nouns">How adjectives become nouns</span></h2>

<p>Most adjectives become nouns by adding the <a href="/Suffix" title="Suffix">suffix</a> <b>ness</b>. Example: Take the adjective 'natural', add 'ness' to get 'naturalness', a noun. To see a list of 100 adjectives used in <a href="/Basic_English" title="Basic English">Basic English</a>, <a href="/Adjective#100_adjectives_used_in_Basic_English" title="Adjective">click here</a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plural_Nouns">Plural Nouns</span></h2>
<p>The plural form of most nouns is created simply by adding the letter <i>s.</i>
</p>
<ul>
<li>more than one snake = snakes</li>
<li>more than one ski = skis</li>
<li>more than one Barrymore = Barrymores</li>
<li/>
</ul>

<p>Note that some dictionaries list "busses" as an acceptable plural for "bus." Presumably, this is because the plural "buses" looks like it ought to rhyme with the plural of "fuse," which is "fuses." "Buses" is still listed as the preferable plural form. "Busses" is the plural, of course, for "buss," a seldom used word for "kiss."</p>
<p>There are several nouns that have irregular plural forms. Plurals formed in this way are sometimes called <b>mutated (or mutating) plurals</b>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>more than one child = children</li>
<li>more than one woman = women</li>
<li>more than one man = men</li>
<li>more than one person = people</li>
<li>more than one goose = geese</li>
<li>more than one mouse = mice</li>
<li>more than one barracks = barracks</li>
<li>more than one deer = deer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>And, finally, there are nouns that maintain their Latin or Greek form in the plural. (See media and data and alumni, below.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>more than one nucleus = nuclei</li>
<li>more than one syllabus = syllabi</li>
<li>more than one focus = foci</li>
<li>more than one fungus = fungi</li>
<li>more than one cactus = cacti (<i>cactuses</i> is acceptable)</li>
<li>more than one thesis = theses</li>
<li>more than one crisis = crises*</li>
<li>more than one phenomenon = phenomena</li>
<li>more than one index = indices (<i>indexes</i> is acceptable)</li>
<li>more than one appendix = appendices (<i>appendixes</i> is acceptable)</li>
<li>more than one criterion = criteria</li>
<li>more than one octopus = octopuses </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
