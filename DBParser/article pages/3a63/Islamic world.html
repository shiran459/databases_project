The <b>Islamic World</b> consists of all people who are in <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>. It is not an exact location, but rather a <a href="/Community" title="Community">community</a>. When they do things together as Muslims, they are the "<a href="/Umma" title="Umma">umma</a>", which means "community" referring to all of the believers. The faith emphasizes unity and defense of fellow Muslims, so it is common for these nations to cooperate. <a href="/Recent_conflicts_in_the_Muslim_World" title="Recent conflicts in the Muslim World">Recent conflicts in the Muslim World</a> have sometimes spread because of this desire to cooperate (see below). It is also likely that some have been made shorter and less damaging because of it. Some might even have never started.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Media">Media</span></h2>
<p>The <i><a href="/Al-Jazeera" title="Al-Jazeera">Al-Jazeera</a></i> satellite TV network in the <a href="/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a> is a news source many Muslims watch.</p>
<p>In most Muslim nations, the government is the main source of news. This sometimes makes it very difficult or dangerous to make anti-government statements.</p>
<p>There are, however, many other news programmes and websites in the Muslim world.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Islam_in_law_and_ethics">Islam in law and ethics</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Islamic_law" title="Islamic law">Islamic law</a> exists in many variations - in Arabic it is called <a href="/Shariah" title="Shariah">shariah</a> - five schools of which were created centuries ago. These are the <a href="/Classical_fiqh" title="Classical fiqh">classical fiqh</a>: the <a href="/Hanafi" title="Hanafi">Hanafi</a> school from <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="/Bangaladesh" title="Bangaladesh">Bangaladesh</a>, <a href="/West_Africa" title="West Africa">West Africa</a>, <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the <a href="/Maliki" title="Maliki">Maliki</a> in <a href="/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> and <a href="/West_Africa" title="West Africa">West Africa</a>, the <a href="/Shafi" title="Shafi">Shafi</a> in <a href="/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, the <a href="/Hanbali" title="Hanbali">Hanbali</a> in <a href="/Arabia" title="Arabia">Arabia</a>, and <a href="/Jaferi" title="Jaferi">Jaferi</a> in <a href="/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> - where the majority is <a href="/Shia" title="Shia">Shia</a>. All five are very old and many Muslims feel a new fiqh must be created for modern <a href="/Society" title="Society">society</a>. Islam has a method for doing this, <a href="/Al-urf" title="Al-urf">al-urf</a> and <a href="/Ijtihad" title="Ijtihad">ijtihad</a> are the words to describe this method, but they have not been used in a long time, and few people are trusted enough to use them to make new laws.</p>
<p>So, in most of the Muslim world, people are very conservative, especially about <a href="/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, <a href="/Adultery" title="Adultery">adultery</a>, <a href="/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a> and <a href="/Women" title="Women">women</a> working in jobs where they are used to lure customers.</p>
<p><a href="/Muslim_women" title="Muslim women">Muslim women</a> often dress extremely modestly, and many do so by choice. But in some countries they have been forced to do so against their will. This is one of the things that causes tension between the <a href="/Western_World" title="Western World">Western World</a> and that of Muslims.</p>
<p><a href="/Islamic_economics" title="Islamic economics">Islamic economics</a> bans <a href="/Debt" title="Debt">debt</a> but in most Muslim countries Western <a href="/Banking" title="Banking">banking</a> is allowed. This is another issue that many Muslims have with the Western world.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Islam_in_politics">Islam in politics</span></h2>
<p>One quarter of the <a href="/World" title="World">world</a> population share Islam as an <a href="/Ethical_tradition" title="Ethical tradition">ethical tradition</a>. </p>
<p>Many people in these countries also see <a href="/Islam_as_a_political_movement" title="Islam as a political movement">Islam as a political movement</a>. In democratic countries there is usually at least one <a href="/Islamic_party" title="Islamic party">Islamic party</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/Political_Islam" title="Political Islam">Political Islam</a> is powerful in all Muslim-majority countries. <a href="/Islamic_parties" title="Islamic parties">Islamic parties</a> in <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> have taken power. </p>
<p>Many in these movements call themselves <a href="/Islamist" title="Islamist">Islamists</a>, which also sometimes describes more <a href="/Militant_Islam" title="Militant Islam">militant Islamic</a> groups. The relationships between these groups and their views of democracy are complex.</p>
<p>Some of these groups are called <a href="/Terrorist" title="Terrorist">terrorists</a> because they attack civilians of other non-Muslim nations, to make a political point.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conflicts_with_Israel_and_the_US">Conflicts with Israel and the US</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> is very unpopular in the Muslim world, because of the <a href="/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> and the way that the state of Israel came into being in <a href="/1948" title="1948">1948</a> which many <a href="/Arab" title="Arab">Arabs</a> thought was unfair.</p>
<p>Some Muslims see this as a fight against <a href="/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> or <a href="/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</a>, but not all. In <a href="/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> for instance, the Islamists recently invited <a href="/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</a> to join the party. Jewish groups also cooperate with Arabs in the <a href="/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, where <a href="/Neturei_Karta" title="Neturei Karta">Neturei Karta</a> (anti-Zionist orthodox Jewish) leader Rabbi <a href="/Mosche_Hirsch" title="Mosche Hirsch">Mosche Hirsch</a> served as the Minister for Jewish Affairs in the <a href="/Fatah" title="Fatah">Fatah</a> before there was a <a href="/Palestinian_Authority" title="Palestinian Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>. Like the Arabs, this small group of Jews thought the way Israel was created was not right. However, very few Jews believe this, and most support Israel as a state.</p>
<p>In <a href="/1979" title="1979">1979</a> there was a big shift in the way the Muslim world dealt with the rest of the world. In that year, <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> made peace with <a href="/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a> became an <a href="/Islamic_state" title="Islamic state">Islamic state</a> after a <a href="/Revolution" title="Revolution">revolution</a>, and there was an <a href="/1979_invasion_of_Afghanistan" title="1979 invasion of Afghanistan">invasion of Afghanistan</a> by the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. A lot of things changed in that year. By <a href="/2001" title="2001">2001</a> the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> was gone, <a href="/Jordan" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> had also made peace with Israel, and on <a href="/September_11%2C_2001" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a> there were major attacks on the U.S. - which most people believe were made to drive the United States out of the Muslim world, especially <a href="/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. In many ways the events of 1979 led to the events of 2001.</p>
<p>The <a href="/2001_invasion_of_Afghanistan" title="2001 invasion of Afghanistan">2001 invasion of Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> are called part of a <a href="/War_on_Terrorism" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a> by the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. Many or most Muslims see it as a <a href="/War_on_Islam" title="War on Islam">War on Islam</a>. After the invasion, the <a href="/Islamic_parties" title="Islamic parties">Islamic parties</a> won more seats, and a majority of Muslims polled in many nations expressed support for <a href="/Osama_bin_Laden" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> and said he would "do the right thing". <a href="/Olivier_Roy" title="Olivier Roy">Olivier Roy</a> is a French scholar who thinks that this does not express support for <a href="/Al-Qaeda" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> or <a href="/Militant_Islam" title="Militant Islam">militant Islam</a> but opposing <a href="/Colonialism" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> and what many Muslims call <a href="/Racism" title="Racism">racism</a> - favourable treatment for Jews especially those living in <a href="/West_Bank_settlement" title="West Bank settlement">West Bank settlements</a>, many of whom have American or British passport, and which the <a href="/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> says have no right to live there.</p>
<p>The situation is very complicated and there are many different views of it.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Organization">Organization</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/Organization_of_Islamic_Conference" title="Organization of Islamic Conference">Organization of Islamic Conference</a> formed in <a href="/1969" title="1969">1969</a> lets the Muslim nations work as a group. <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> joined in <a href="/2003" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Arab_League" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> is a smaller group of only the Arab countries.</p>
<p><a href="/OPEC" title="OPEC">OPEC</a> is another forum where issues between the Muslim and non-Muslim world come up. In <a href="/1973" title="1973">1973</a> to protest U.S. support for Israel there was an <a href="/1973_oil_embargo" title="1973 oil embargo">oil embargo</a> which caused the <a href="/1973_energy_crisis" title="1973 energy crisis">1973 energy crisis</a>.</p>
