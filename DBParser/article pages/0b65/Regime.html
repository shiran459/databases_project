<p>A <b>regime</b> is the <a href="/Leader" title="Leader">leader</a> and other people who run a <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> of a <a href="/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">sovereign state</a>.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of regimes.  They can achieve <a href="/Influence" title="Influence">power</a> in many ways.  Depending on the time and place and local <a href="/Civics" title="Civics">civics</a> like the <a href="/Electoral_system" title="Electoral system">electoral system</a>, they can lose power in many ways too.  The most common way for a regime to lose power was a <a href="/Coup" title="Coup">coup</a>, <a href="/Invasion" title="Invasion">invasion</a> or <a href="/Revolution" title="Revolution">revolution</a> until the <a href="/20th_century" title="20th century">20th century</a>.  After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods.  Peaceful regime change is usually by an <a href="/Election" title="Election">election</a> - this method is now used by more than half the people on the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>.  It is called <a href="/Representative_democracy" title="Representative democracy">representative democracy</a>.  Such regimes are often called <b>administration</b>s to make it clear they are not <a href="/Dictator" title="Dictator">dictators</a>, and since the <a href="/Executive_branch" title="Executive branch">executive branch</a> does not have all the power itself - it may share it with a <a href="/Legislative_branch" title="Legislative branch">legislative branch</a>.  Also the <a href="/Judicial_branch" title="Judicial branch">judicial branch</a> is separate.  The <a href="/Court" title="Court">courts</a> are not usually considered part of the regime.</p>
<p>However, some things are the same no matter how the regime achieved power:</p>

<ul>
<li>The regime needs help among people outside the regime and government to stay in power - these may be in the <a href="/Military" title="Military">military</a> or a <a href="/Political_party" title="Political party">political party</a>.</li>
<li>Military and <a href="/Police" title="Police">police</a> obey the regime's orders, and can kill people.  If they would not do so, then, it would be possible to change regimes by force.</li>
<li><a href="/Trade" title="Trade">Trade</a> and <a href="/Tax" title="Tax">tax</a> is set by the regime, which can take <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> away.</li>
<li>The regime speaks for the whole country when dealing with other countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>When many regimes negotiate at the <a href="/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> or <a href="/World_Trade_Organization" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a>, it does not matter at all how each regime got its power.  It matters only that they can agree and make everyone in their country do as the agreement says.</p>
<p>When someone wants a regime to change in another country, they usually are not able to do this by any means other than violence or interfering in its <a href="/Election" title="Election">election</a>.  This is common if a regime is threatened by another regime.</p></div>
