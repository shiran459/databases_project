<p>According to certain <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religions</a> and <a href="/List_of_mythologies" title="List of mythologies">mythologies</a>, <b>God</b> is the creator of the Earth and of everything else.  <a href="/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> says that there is more than one god. <a href="/Theist" title="Theist">Theists</a> believe that God created everything that <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exist">exists</a> and has ever existed.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Swinburne"><a href="#_note-Swinburne" title="">[1]</a></sup> In most religions, God is believed to be immortal (cannot die), and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans.</p>
<p>The belief that there is at least one god is usually called <a href="/Theism" title="Theism">theism</a>. People who reject belief that any deities exist are called <a href="/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheists</a>. <a href="/Agnosticism" title="Agnosticism">Agnostics</a> think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist, but still might (or might not) believe at least one deity exists.

<p>In some religions there are many <a href="/Deity" title="Deity">gods</a>. This is called <a href="/Polytheism" title="Polytheism">polytheism</a>. In other religions, there is only one, which is called <a href="/Monotheism" title="Monotheism">monotheism</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Does_God_exist.3F">Does God exist?</span></h2>
<p>Many people have asked themselves if God exists. Philosophers, theologians, and others have tried to prove that it exists, and others have tried to disprove the theory. In <a href="/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophical</a> terminology, such arguments are about the <a href="/Epistemology" title="Epistemology">epistemology</a> of the <a href="/Ontology" title="Ontology">ontology</a> of God. The debate exists mainly in philosophy, as science does not address whether or not <a href="/Supernatural" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> things exist.</p>
<p>There are many philosophical issues with the existence of God. Some definitions of God are not specific.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Arguments for the existence of God typically include <a href="/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a>, <a href="/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empirical</a>, <a href="/Inductive_reasoning" title="Inductive reasoning">inductive</a>, and subjective types. Some theories are built around holes in <a href="/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolutionary theory</a>, as well as order and complexity in the <a href="/World" title="World">world</a>. Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical, <a href="/Deductive_reasoning" title="Deductive reasoning">deductive</a>, and inductive arguments. Conclusions sometimes include: "God does not exist" (<a href="/Atheism" title="Atheism">strong atheism</a>); "God almost certainly does not exist"<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Dawkins"><a href="#_note-Dawkins" title="">[3]</a></sup> (<i>de facto</i> <a href="/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheism</a>); "no one knows whether God exists" (<a href="/Agnosticism" title="Agnosticism">agnosticism</a>); "God exists, but this cannot be proven or disproven" (<a href="/Deism" title="Deism">deism</a> or <a href="/Theism" title="Theism">theism</a>); and "God exists and this can be proven" (theism). There are many variations on these positions, and sometimes different names for some of them. For example, the position "God exists and this can be proven" is sometimes called "gnostic theism" or "strong theism".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Names">Names</span></h2>
<p>There are different names for God in different religions. Some examples are <a href="/Allah" title="Allah">Allah</a> in Islam, <a href="/Yahweh" title="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> or <a href="/Elohim" title="Elohim">Elohim</a> in Judaism, <a href="/God_in_the_Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith" title="God in the Bahá'í Faith">Baha</a> in <a href="/Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>, and <a href="/Ahura_Mazda" title="Ahura Mazda">Ahura Mazda</a> in Zoroastrianism.</p>

<p><a href="/Abrahamic_religions" title="Abrahamic religions">Abrahamic religions</a> are very popular monotheistic ones. Well-known Abrahamic religions include <a href="/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>.  <a href="/Monotheistic" title="Monotheistic">Monotheistic</a> means the people in these religions believe there is only one God.  The name of God is usually not allowed to be said in <a href="/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, but some Jews today call him <a href="/YHWH" title="YHWH">YHWH</a> (Yahweh) or Jehovah. <a href="/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> say the word <a href="/Allah" title="Allah">Allah</a>, which is the <a href="/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> word for "The God." </p>

<p>{{main|God in Christianity}}
The <a href="/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> talks about God in different ways. Christians say that the <a href="/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> talks about "God the Father". The <a href="/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> is about <a href="/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, or "God the Son". Many Christians also believe that Jesus was God's <a href="/Incarnation" title="Incarnation">incarnation</a> on earth.  Christians consider the <a href="/Holy_Spirit" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> to be God as well.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (also known as the Holy Ghost). This is called the <a href="/Trinity" title="Trinity">Holy Trinity</a> by most people who believe in it. Although the word "Trinity" is not in the Bible, the word used for God in chapter one of <a href="/Genesis" title="Genesis">Genesis</a> is <a href="/Plural" title="Plural">plural</a>, and the words ' in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit' are used in the <a href="/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, (e.g. <a href="/Gospel_of_Matthew" title="Gospel of Matthew">Matthew</a> 28:19) Another word that most Christians believe means the same thing as "Trinity" is Godhead. </p>
<p>Some believe that Jesus was just a man that talked about God. Members of the <a href="/Unitarian_Church" title="Unitarian Church">Unitarian Church</a> have this beliefs.</p>
<p>Christians believe that <a href="/Incarnation" title="Incarnation">God turned into a man</a> named <a href="/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, and came to Earth to save everyone from <a href="/Sin" title="Sin">sin</a>. When Jesus prayed and talked to God, he called him "Father," and taught others to do the same.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="God_in_Eastern_religions">God in Eastern religions</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, there is only one God, named <a href="/Brahman" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>, but Brahman is said to have taken on many different <a href="/Incarnation" title="Incarnation">incarnations</a>. Some of these are <a href="/Rama" title="Rama">Rama</a>, <a href="/Krishna" title="Krishna">Krishna</a>, <a href="/Buddha" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>, <a href="/Shiva" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, <a href="/Kali" title="Kali">Kali</a>, <a href="/Parvati" title="Parvati">Parvati</a>, and <a href="/Durga" title="Durga">Durga</a>. To many outsiders, the worship of God's different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods. However, it is really only the worship of one God in different ways.</p>
<p>Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone. This idea is called <a href="/Advaita_Vedanta" title="Advaita Vedanta">Advaita Vedanta</a>, which is the Hindu term for <a href="/Monism" title="Monism">Monism</a>.</p>
<p>Religions like <a href="/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> involve the worship of many gods, or sometimes no gods at all.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="God_in_Western_philosophy">God in Western philosophy</span></h2>
<p>Philosophers can talk about God or god; sometimes they talk about a specific god, but other times they are just talking about the idea of god.</p>
<p>One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <a href="/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, who describes god as the Supreme Cause. Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen, but is not influenced by anything else.</p>
<p>There are also some philosophical problems with God. One of them is called <a href="/God_paradox" title="God paradox">God paradox</a>. It is a question about whether (an omnipotent) God can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it.</p>
