<p>We can define a sound wave as a disturbance which travels through some medium.
<b>Sound</b> is the term to describe what is <a href="/Hearing" title="Hearing">heard</a> when sound <a href="/Wave_(physics)" title="Wave (physics)">waves</a> pass through a <a href="/Media" title="Media">medium</a> to the <a href="/Ear" title="Ear">ear</a>. All sounds are made by <a href="/Vibration" title="Vibration">vibrations</a> of molecules through which the sound travels. For instance, when a <a href="/Drum" title="Drum">drum</a> or a <a href="/Cymbal" title="Cymbal">cymbal</a> is struck, the object <a href="/Vibration" title="Vibration">vibrates</a>. These vibrations make <a href="/Air" title="Air">air</a> <a href="/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a> move. Sound waves move away from their source (where they came from), traveling on the <a href="/Air" title="Air">air</a> <a href="/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a>. When the vibrating air molecules reach our <a href="/Ear" title="Ear">ears</a>, the <a href="/Eardrum" title="Eardrum">eardrum</a> vibrates, too. The bones of the ear vibrate in the same way that of the object that started the sound wave. </p>
<p>These vibrations let you hear different sounds. Even <a href="/Music" title="Music">music</a> is vibrations. Irregular vibrations are <a href="/Noise" title="Noise">noise</a>. People can can make very complex sounds. We use them for <a href="/Speech" title="Speech">speech</a>.</p>
<p>Sound waves are <a href="/Longitudinal_wave" title="Longitudinal wave">longitudinal waves</a> with two parts: <i><a href="/Compression" title="Compression">compression</a></i> and <i>rarefaction</i>. Compression is the part of the sound waves where the molecules of air are pushed (<i>compressed</i>) together. Rarefaction is the part of the waves where the molecules are far away from each other. Sound waves are a <a href="/Sequence" title="Sequence">sequence</a> of compressions and rarefactions.</p>

<p>{{Main|Speed of sound}}
Sound waves can travel through <a href="/Solid" title="Solid">solids</a>, <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a>, and <a href="/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a>, but it cannot travel through a <a href="/Vacuum" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a> (a place with nothing in it). This is why <a href="/Astronaut" title="Astronaut">astronauts</a> can not talk to each other in space: they need a <a href="/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a> to hear each other. Sound can travel through water faster than through air; and they travel even faster in solids like <a href="/Stone" title="Stone">stone</a>, <a href="/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a>, and <a href="/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a>. Sound travels at 335 metres (1,100 feet) per second in the air.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-whee"><a href="#_note-whee" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pitch_and_Intensity">Pitch and Intensity</span></h2>

<p><i>Pitch</i> is the highness or lowness of sound. <a href="/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch (music)">Pitch</a> is how humans hear different frequencies. <a href="/Frequency" title="Frequency">Frequency</a> is determined by the number of vibrations per second. The highest key on a <a href="/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a>, for instance, vibrates 4,000 times per second. It has a frequency of 4000 <a href="/Hertz" title="Hertz">hertz</a> (Hz), or 4 kilohertz (kHz). Lower keys have lower frequencies. A note an <a href="/Octave" title="Octave">octave</a> higher than another note has twice the frequency of that note.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-whee_b"><a href="#_note-whee" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The intensity of a sound is how much sound energy goes through a square meter in one second. Sound waves with higher amplitude (bigger vibration) have higher intensity. The intensity of a sound is higher closer to the sound source. Farther away, it's less intense. The <a href="/Inverse-square_law" title="Inverse-square law">inverse-square law</a> shows how sound intensity becomes smaller, farther from the source. "Inverse square" says that when distance gets multiplied by a number, sound intensity gets divided by that number squared (the number times itself).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-whee_c"><a href="#_note-whee" title="">[1]</a></sup> Thus, twice the distance means a quarter the intensity. </p>
<p>Sound intensities can be very different. They can range from 0.000000000001, which are barely heard, to 1 W/m<sup>2</sup>  (painfully loud). The <a href="/Decibel" title="Decibel">decibel</a> scale makes sound intensity numbers easier to work with. A 0.000000000001 W/m<sup>2</sup> intensity is 0 dB (decibels). When the decibel number increases by 10, the intensity is ten times as much. So, a 1 W/m<sup>2</sup> intensity is 120 dB.</p>
<p>Loudness is how people sense the intensity of sound. Loudness depends on sound intensity, sound frequency, and the person's hearing.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Heard_and_not_seen">Heard and not seen</span></h3>

<p>Audible sound has <a href="/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequencies</a> between 20 <a href="/Hertz" title="Hertz">Hz</a> to 20 kHz. <a href="/Human_being" title="Human being">Human beings</a> can hear audible sound. Sound waves with frequency above 20 kHz are called <a href="/Ultrasound" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> waves. Sound waves with frequency below 20 Hz are called <a href="/Infrasound" title="Infrasound">infrasound</a> waves. Human beings cannot hear ultrasound waves and infrasound waves, but some animals, like <a href="/Bat" title="Bat">bats</a> and <a href="/Dolphin" title="Dolphin">dolphins</a>, use them. Older people have an even smaller hearing range. People are best at hearing sounds between 1000 Hz and 6000 Hz.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Doppler_Effect">The Doppler Effect</span></h3>
<p>When a sound source is moving towards someone, the frequency seems to increase. The same thing happens when someone moves toward the sound source. Frequency seems to decrease when someone moves away from a sound source. It also seems to decrease when the sound source moves away from someone. This is called the <a href="/Doppler_effect" title="Doppler effect">Doppler effect</a>.</p>
