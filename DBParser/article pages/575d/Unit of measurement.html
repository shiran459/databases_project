<p><a href="/Measure" title="Measure">Measurement</a> is a process that uses <a href="/Number" title="Number">numbers</a> to describe a <a href="/Physical_quantity" title="Physical quantity">physical quantity</a> based on what we can <a href="/Observation" title="Observation">observe</a>. This is done to be able to compare them to each other. We can measure how big things are, how warm they are, how heavy they are, and lots of other features as well.  <b>Units of Measurement</b> provide standards for our comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing.  For example, the <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">metre</a> is a standard unit to measure <a href="/Length" title="Length">length</a>.  Before 1982, it was defined as the distance between two markers on a special rod.  Now scientists define the metre by using the <a href="/Speed_of_light" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>.</p>
<p>Saying something has a length of 2 metres means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre, or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance.</p>
<p>Today, most units of measure fall into one of three <a href="/System_of_measurement" title="System of measurement">systems</a>:</p>
<p>The older two, the <a href="/Imperial_units" title="Imperial units">British imperial system</a> and the closely related <a href="/United_States_customary_units" title="United States customary units">US customary system</a> use the <a href="/Foot_(unit_of_length)" title="Foot (unit of length)">foot</a> as a measure of length, the <a href="/Pound_(mass)" title="Pound (mass)">pound</a> as a measure for <a href="/Weight" title="Weight">weight</a>, and the <a href="/Second" title="Second">second</a> as a measure for time. They use other units as well. The number of smaller units that make the bigger units in these two systems varies: For example, there are 12 <a href="/Inch" title="Inch">inches</a> in a foot and 16 <a href="/Ounce" title="Ounce">ounces</a> in a pound. </p>
<p>The newest of the three systems is the <a href="/Metric_system" title="Metric system">metric system</a> or <a href="/SI_units" title="SI units">SI system</a> which usually use 10, 100 or 1000 of a smaller unit to make a bigger one: For instance, there are 100 centimetres in 1 metre or 1000 grams in 1 kilogram. This system uses the metre for length, the <a href="/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a> for weight, and, like the other two systems, the second for time.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Number_and_Unit_of_measure">Number and Unit of measure</span></h2>
<p>The property of the thing being measured is given as a <a href="/Number" title="Number">number</a> of units of measure. The number only has <a href="/Sense" title="Sense">sense</a> when the unit of measurement is also given.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="/Eiffel_Tower" title="Eiffel Tower">The Eiffel Tower</a> in <a href="/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> is 300 <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">meters</a> <a href="/Height" title="Height">tall</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> That is, the <a href="/Distance" title="Distance">distance</a> from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel Tower is 300 meters. The property of the Eiffel Tower being measured is a distance. The number measured is 300. This number does not make <a href="/Sense" title="Sense">sense</a> without the unit of measure. The unit of measure is the meter.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Measurement_Standards">Measurement Standards</span></h2>

<p><a href="/Standard" title="Standard">Standards</a> are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement.  A metre stick is an example of a standard.  When you measure something with a metre stick, you can compare that measurement to anything else that is also measured with a metre stick. This makes measurement <a href="/Easier" title="Easier">easier</a> and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comparison">comparisons</a> between measurements easier.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Size_of_Units_of_Measurement">Size of Units of Measurement</span></h2>

<p>There are units of measurement of different sizes. There are small units of measurement to measure small things. There are big units of measurement to measure big things.</p>
<p><a href="/Science" title="Science">Science</a>, <a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a> and <a href="/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a> use smaller units of measurement to measure small things with less <a href="/Error" title="Error">error</a>. It is <a href="/Easier" title="Easier">easier</a> to measure large things using larger units of measurement.  Large measurements like the <a href="/Width" title="Width">width</a> of a <a href="/Galaxy" title="Galaxy">galaxy</a> and small measurements like the <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> of an <a href="/Atom" title="Atom">atom</a> use special units of measurement.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Systems_of_Units_of_Measurement">Systems of Units of Measurement</span></h2>
<p>There are many different standards and units used all over the world. Most became less used during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>

<p>The <a href="/Metric_system" title="Metric system">metric system</a> is a system of measurement used in most of the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">world</a>. It is also called the International System of Units, or <a href="/SI" title="SI">SI</a>.</p>
<p>Units of measure in the metric system include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The units of <a href="/Length" title="Length">length</a> or <a href="/Linear_size" title="Linear size">linear size</a> are based on the <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">metre</a>. They include the <a href="/Kilometre" title="Kilometre">kilometre</a> (<i>km</i>) which is 1000 meters, the <a href="/Centimetre" title="Centimetre">centimetre</a> (<i>cm</i>), and the <a href="/Millimetre" title="Millimetre">millimetre</a> (<i>mm</i>) which is 1/1000th of a meter.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The unit of <a href="/Volume" title="Volume">volume</a> is the <a href="/Litre" title="Litre">litre</a>. It is used for measuring an amount of <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquid</a>.  A <a href="/Millilitre" title="Millilitre">millilitre</a> (<a href="/Abbreviate" title="Abbreviate">abbreviated</a> as <i>ml</i>) is the amount of liquid that would fill up a <a href="/Cube" title="Cube">cube</a> that measures 1 centimetre on each side. One l litre of liquid would fill up a <a href="/Cube" title="Cube">cube</a> that is 10 cm on each side.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The unit of <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> is the <a href="/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a>.  A kilogram (<i>kg</i>) weighs the same as a litre of water (at normal temperature, and pressure). 1 gram (<i>g</i>) is the weight of 1 millilitre of <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> at 0 degrees <a href="/Celsius" title="Celsius">Celsius</a>.  The metric <a href="/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonne</a> is 1000 kilograms or a <a href="/Million" title="Million">million</a> grams.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="British_imperial_Units">British imperial Units</span></h3>
<p>{{main|imperial units}}
Imperial units were defined in the United Kingdom in 1825. These units sometimes based on similar units that were in use before 1825. Imperial units were used in countries that were part of the <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. While many of these countries, including the United Kingdom, have officially adopted SI, the older system of units are still used.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="US_customary_units">US customary units</span></h3>
<p>{{main|United States customary units}}
US customary units are the official units used in the US. These are similar to the British imperial units and also based on the units used in the United Kingdom from before <a href="/American_Revolution" title="American Revolution">American Independence</a>. Some of the units are different to the British ones. For example, there are 20 imperial fluid ounces in an imperial pint, but 16 US fluid ounces in a US pint. Additionally, the US fluid ounce is slightly bigger than the imperial fluid ounce. The result is that US pints and gallons are smaller than imperial pints and gallons. In the United States, the metric system has been legal for trade since 1866 but other measurements such as the gallon, inch, and the pound are still widely used.</p>
<p>Imperial and US units of measurement include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Length - <a href="/Inch" title="Inch">inch</a> (<i>in</i>), <a href="/Foot_(unit_of_length)" title="Foot (unit of length)">foot</a> (<i>ft</i>), <a href="/Yard" title="Yard">yard</a> (<i>yd</i>), and <a href="/Mile" title="Mile">mile</a>.
<ul>
<li>1 foot = 12 inches</li>
<li>1 yard = 3 feet (plural of foot) = 36 inches</li>
<li>1 mile = 1760 yards = 5280 feet</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Imperial volume - <a href="/Imperial_fluid_ounce" title="Imperial fluid ounce">imperial fluid ounce</a> (<i>fl oz</i>), <a href="/Imperial_pint" title="Imperial pint">imperial pint</a> (<i>pt</i>), and <a href="/Imperial_gallon" title="Imperial gallon">imperial gallon</a> (<i>gal</i>).
<ul>
<li>1 imperial pint = 20 imperial fluid ounces</li>
<li>1 imperial gallon = 8 imperial pints</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>US volume - US fluid ounces (<i>fl oz</i>), <a href="/Cup_(unit)" title="Cup (unit)">US cup</a> (<i>cp</i>), <a href="/US_pint" title="US pint">US pint</a> (<i>pt</i>), <a href="/US_quart" title="US quart">US quart</a> (<i>qt</i>), and <a href="/US_gallon" title="US gallon">US gallon</a> (<i>gal</i>).
<ul>
<li>1 US cup = 8 US fluid ounces</li>
<li>1 US pint = 2 US cups = 16 US fluid ounces</li>
<li>1 US quart = 2 US pints</li>
<li>1 US gallon = 4 US quarts = 8 US pints</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><a href="/Weight" title="Weight">Weight</a> and <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> are measured in ounces (<i>oz</i>) and pounds (<i>lb</i>), and <a href="/Stone_(unit)" title="Stone (unit)">stone</a> (<i>st</i>) in imperial only.
<ul>
<li>1 pound = 16 ounces</li>
<li>1 stone = 14 pounds</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The ounces for weight and volume are different. Even when measuring <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>, the number of ounces of weight is not the same as the number of fluid ounces.</p>
