A <b>Power network</b> is a type of <a href="/Contact_network" title="Contact network">contact network</a> where its members can tell other people what to do.</p>
<p>It must be large enough to literally scare or force people to go along with its <a href="/Request" title="Request">requests</a>, which makes them <a href="/Order" title="Order">orders</a>. This typically requires thousands of people in constant touch with each other.</p>
<p>A <a href="/Political_party" title="Political party">political party</a> is the most obvious example.  It is typically much larger than a <a href="/Social_network" title="Social network">social network</a> but is not one, since people can only call on each other for a small number of reasons, and perhaps at specific times.  Also not every member of the network has the same role or right to help.</p>
<p>A <a href="/Corporation" title="Corporation">corporation</a> may also be a power network if it relies on many <a href="/Power_relation" title="Power relation">power relations</a> to maintain itself - for instance, the right to draw <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a> from the ground or dump <a href="/Waste" title="Waste">waste</a> without being held responsible for it.</p>
<p>When a power network achieves some stable grasp of political <a href="/Influence" title="Influence">power</a> and daily working control of some important <a href="/Infrastructure" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, it becomes a <a href="/Power_structure" title="Power structure">power structure</a>.  In a <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> the visible power networks represented by the parties compete regularly in an <a href="/Election" title="Election">election</a> - but much of the power structure, typically the <a href="/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>, does not change, and is typically ignored as a power network in itself.</p>
