<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Different_kinds_of_the_same_disease">Different kinds of the same disease</span></h2>
<p>There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of <a href="/Flea" title="Flea">flea</a>, that lives on <a href="/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>. Then there is an <a href="/Incubation_period" title="Incubation period">incubation period</a> which can last from a few hours to about seven days. 
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Septicemic_plague"><a href="/Septicemic_plague" title="Septicemic plague">Septicemic plague</a></span></h3>
<p><a href="/Sepsis" title="Sepsis">Sepsis</a> happens when the bacterium enters the <a href="/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> and makes it form tiny clots.
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pneumonic_plague"><a href="/Pneumonic" title="Pneumonic">Pneumonic</a> plague</span></h3>
<p>This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_abortive_form">The abortive form</span></h3>
<p>This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little <a href="/Fever" title="Fever">fever</a>. After that, there are <a href="/Antibody" title="Antibody">antibodies</a> that protect against all forms for a long time.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>During the 1300s, this <a href="/Epidemic" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a> struck parts of <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, and <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/catastrophe">catastrophes</a> that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. <a href="/Giovanni_Boccaccio" title="Giovanni Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a>, an <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> writer of the time, described it: <i>"This <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scourge">scourge</a> had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abandon">abandoned</a> brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children."</i><sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transmission">Transmission</span></h2>


<p>
The plague was not just carried by <a href="/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a> as some people assume. The <a href="/Flea" title="Flea">fleas</a> also carried it. It came from abroad, from <a href="/Kaffa" title="Kaffa">Kaffa</a> by the <a href="/Black_Sea" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. From there the disease started to go new places in <a href="/1347" title="1347">1347</a>. It went to <a href="/England" title="England">England</a> in <a href="/1349" title="1349">1349</a>. There it killed <b>half</b> of the people in England. 70% of people who got plague died. Pigs are also to blame for the transmission, as the bacteria stayed in their blood system, and when eaten, people caught the plague. This is a reason why so few Jews or Muslims caught the disease.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_history">Modern history</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="/20th_century" title="20th century">20th century</a>, some countries did <a href="/Research" title="Research">research</a> on the <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for <a href="/Biological_warfare" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a>.</p>
<p>Samples of this <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> are carefully controlled. There is much <a href="/Paranoia" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a> (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a <a href="/United_States" title="United States">US</a> expert in this <a href="/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a> was charged in October <a href="/2003" title="2003">2003</a> by the <a href="/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a> with various <a href="/Crime" title="Crime">crimes</a>. This happened after he said he lost samples of <i><a href="/Yersinia_pestis" title="Yersinia pestis">Yersinia pestis</a></i>. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.</p>
