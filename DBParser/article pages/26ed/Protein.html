<p><b>Proteins</b> are long-chain <a href="/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a> built from small units known as <a href="/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>. They are joined together with <a href="/Peptide_bond" title="Peptide bond">peptide bonds</a>. </p>

<p>Proteins do different things depending on their shape. They can be found in <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a> or <a href="/Muscle" title="Muscle">muscle</a>. They are used for growth and repair, as well as for strengthening the bones. They help to make tissue and cells. They are in <a href="/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a>, <a href="/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>, fungi, bacteria, and also in the <a href="/Human" title="Human">human</a> body. </p>
<p><a href="/Muscle" title="Muscle">Muscles</a> contain a lot of protein. When protein is digested, it is broken down into amino acids. These amino acids can then be used to build new protein. Proteins form an important part in foods like <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a>, <a href="/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a>, <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a>, <a href="/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>, <a href="/Bean" title="Bean">beans</a>, and <a href="/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a> and pulses. There are four things that determine what a protein will do. The first is the order of the amino acids. There are 20 different types of amino acids. The second is the little twists in the chain. The third is how the entire thing is folded up. The fourth is whether it is made up of different sub-units. <a href="/Haemoglobin" title="Haemoglobin">Haemoglobin</a> molecules, for example, are made of four sub-units.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Damaging_mutations">Damaging mutations</span></h3>
<p>Most proteins are <a href="/Enzymes" title="Enzymes">enzymes</a>, and <a href="/Mutations" title="Mutations">mutations</a> may slow them or stop them working. 50% of human <a href="/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancers</a> are caused by mutations in the <a href="/Tumour" title="Tumour">tumour</a> suppressor <a href="/P53" title="P53">p53</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> p53 is a protein which regulates <a href="/Cell_division" title="Cell division">cell division</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Essential_amino_acids">Essential amino acids</span></h3>
<p>Proteins are necessary in an animal's diets, since animals cannot make all the amino acids they need (they can make most of them). They must get certain amino acids from food. These are called the <i>essential amino acids</i>. Through <a href="/Digestion" title="Digestion">digestion</a>, animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids. The amino acids are then used in <a href="/Metabolism" title="Metabolism">metabolism</a> to make the <a href="/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> and structures the body needs.</p>
<p>There are nine essential amino acids for humans, which are obtained from food. Meat contains all the essential amino acids humans need; most plants do not. However, eating a mixture of plants, such as both <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> <i>and</i> <a href="/Peanut_butter" title="Peanut butter">peanut butter</a>, or <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a> <i>and</i> <a href="/Bean" title="Bean">beans</a>, provides all the essential amino acids needed. <a href="/Soy" title="Soy">Soy</a> products like <a href="/Tofu" title="Tofu">tofu</a> provide all the essential amino acids--as does <a href="/Quinoa" title="Quinoa">quinoa</a>--but these are not the only way to get the protein humans need.</p>
<p>The scientist <a href="/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius" title="Jöns Jacob Berzelius">Jöns Jacob Berzelius</a> gave proteins their name,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Hartley"><a href="#_note-Hartley" title="">[6]</a></sup> but many other scientists have studied proteins.</p>
