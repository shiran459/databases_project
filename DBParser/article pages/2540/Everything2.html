<p><b>Everything2</b> or <b>E2</b> is a <a href="/Website" title="Website">website</a>.  It lets people make pages about many different things, and some people use it as a <a href="/Diary" title="Diary">diary</a>.</p>
<p>E2 users create pages called <i>nodes</i> and add stuff in <i>writeups</i>.  Only logged-in users can create writeups.  Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners (called "gods") choose can edit the writeup.  On the other hand, on <a href="/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, anyone can edit pages, but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages.</p>
<p>Everything2 does not require a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_point_of_view">neutral point of view</a> like Wikipedia does. So, it is possible to have more than one article (writeups) under the same title (node), each by different authors, and presenting different points of view.</p>
