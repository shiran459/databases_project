<p><b>Spache Readability Formula</b> is one method of finding out how hard a piece of <a href="/Write" title="Write">writing</a> is (its <a href="/Textual_difficulty" title="Textual difficulty">textual difficulty</a>).</p>
<p>The method compares <a href="/Word" title="Word">words</a> in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called <i>unfamiliar</i>. The <a href="/Number" title="Number">number</a> of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a <a href="/Formula" title="Formula">formula</a>. The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text.</p>
<p>Spache works best on texts that are for <a href="/Child" title="Child">children</a> under the age of eight.</p>
<p>the formula; (0.141 * average sentence length)+(0.086 * percentage of difficult words)+0.839 = grade level</p>
<p>According to Oleander Solutions (<a class="external autonumber" href="http://www.oleandersolutions.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), the revised Spache Formula is:</p>
<pre>   GL = (.121 * ASL) + (.082 *UW) + .659 
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<pre>   GL = U.S. grade level
   ASL = Average sentence length
   UW = Number of unique unfamiliar words
</pre>
