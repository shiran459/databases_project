<p><b>Social capital</b> is the willingness of people to help each other.  </p>
<p>It often replaces <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> which people would use to <a href="/Buy" title="Buy">buy</a> the same help.</p>
<p><a href="/Society" title="Society">Society</a> works best when there is plenty of social capital. The less social capital there is, the more social <a href="/Problem" title="Problem">problems</a> there usually are. If there is no social capital, <a href="/War" title="War">war</a> and <a href="/Revolution" title="Revolution">revolution</a> often <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/result">results</a>.</p>
<p>People who have no <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> and cannot get help from <a href="/Society" title="Society">society</a> may have to agree to do things they do not want to do, or force others to do things they do not want to.  <a href="/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">Organized crime</a> grows in this way, and so do <a href="/Forced_labour" title="Forced labour">forced labour</a> and <a href="/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a>.</p>
<p>Most ways of <a href="/Measure" title="Measure">measuring</a> social capital have to do with <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trust">trust</a> - people who trust that favours and help will be available when they need it will favour and help others more.  Those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help.  A social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping.  Some call this kind of person a social <a href="/Parasite" title="Parasite">parasite</a>. They are very hard to detect, unlike people who <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cheat">cheat</a> or commit <a href="/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a>. When there are too many of these kinds of people, especially when they are <a href="/Politician" title="Politician">politicians</a>, people begin to {{broken wikt link|mistrust|mistrust}} their <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a>.  Rather than work with a <a href="/Political_party" title="Political party">political party</a> to change <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a>, they may start to look for direct <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revenge">revenge</a> for things. </p>
<p>Social capital is a lot like real <a href="/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a>. The more money a person or a society has, the easier it is to do things and the better off people are. The less money, the more difficult things become and the worse people feel.</p>
