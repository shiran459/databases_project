<p>An <b>oxymoron</b>  is a term for a <a href="/Figure_of_speech" title="Figure of speech">figure of speech</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>   It is made up of two or more <a href="/Word" title="Word">words</a> that seem to be opposite to each other, or actually are opposite.</p>
<p>For example, the words "Wise fool", "Warm freezer", "Legal murder" all have two words. In each one, the one word looks like the opposite of the other word.</p>
<p>You can have words that look opposite, but are right. For example, a "warm freezer" could be right. A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open.</p>
<p>The word oxymoron is an oxymoron; 'oxy' comes from the Greek word that means 'sharp', while 'moron' comes from the <a href="/Greek_Language" title="Greek Language">Greek</a> word that means 'dull'.</p>
<p>Words that really are opposite to each other, would be words that just cannot be put together. For example, a "round square" could not happen because squares are not round.</p>
<p>Oxymorons sometimes appear in <a href="/Joke" title="Joke">jokes</a>. Sometimes, the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron. For example, a joke that says that "honest politician" is an oxymoron. This means that politicians are dishonest, if the word 'politician' is opposite to 'honest'.</p>
