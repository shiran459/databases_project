A <b>first language</b> (also <b>mother tongue</b>, <b>native language</b>, <b>arterial language</b>, or <b>L1</b>) is the language a person first learns.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> A person's first language helps them understand words and concepts in the style of that first language.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes <i>first language</i> means the language a person speaks best (his <a href="/Second_language" title="Second language">second language</a> is the language he speaks less well than his first language, etc.).  In this case <i>first language</i>, <i>second language</i> and <i>third language</i> show how well one speaks a language, so a person can have more than one first language or second language.</p>
