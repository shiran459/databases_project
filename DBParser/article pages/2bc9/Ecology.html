<p><b>Ecology</b> is the <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a> which studies the <a href="/Biota" title="Biota">biota</a>, the <a href="/Environment" title="Environment">environment</a>, and their interactions. It comes from the <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <i>oikos</i> = house; <i>logos</i> = study. </p>
<p>Ecology is the study of <a href="/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of <a href="/Biodiversity" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, ecologists research everything from tiny <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> in <a href="/Nutrient" title="Nutrient">nutrient</a> <a href="/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a> to the effects of <a href="/Tropical" title="Tropical">tropical</a> <a href="/Rain_forest" title="Rain forest">rain forests</a> on the <a href="/Earth's_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>.  Scientists who study these interactions are called <i>ecologists</i>. </p>
<p><a href="/Terrestrial_ecoregion" title="Terrestrial ecoregion">Terrestrial ecoregion</a> and <a href="/Climate_change" title="Climate change">climate change</a> research are two areas where ecologists now focus.</p>
<p>There are many practical applications of ecology in <a href="/Conservation" title="Conservation">conservation</a> biology, <a href="/Wetland" title="Wetland">wetland</a> management, <a href="/Natural_resource" title="Natural resource">natural resource</a> management (<a href="/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="/Forestry" title="Forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="/Fishing" title="Fishing">fisheries</a>), city <a href="/Planning" title="Planning">planning</a> (urban ecology), <a href="/Community_health" title="Community health">community health</a>, <a href="/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>, and applied science.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology_in_politics">Ecology in politics</span></h2>
<p>Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement, wellness movement, environmental movement, and ecology movement we know today. When these are combined with <a href="/Peace" title="Peace">peace</a> movements and the Six Principles, they are called <a href="/Green" title="Green">green</a> movements. In general, these put <a href="/Ecosystem_health" title="Ecosystem health">ecosystem health</a> first on a list of human moral and political priorities, as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony, and better <a href="/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>. </p>
<p>People with these beliefs are called political ecologists. Some have organized into the Green Parties, but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties. They very often use arguments from ecology to advance <a href="/Policy" title="Policy">policy</a>, especially <a href="/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> policy and energy <a href="/Policy" title="Policy">policy</a>.</p>
<p>Also, ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment, including other organisms.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology_includes_economics">Ecology includes economics</span></h2>
<p>Many ecologists also deal with human economics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/Lynn_Margulis" title="Lynn Margulis">Lynn Margulis</a> says that economics studies how humans make a living, while ecology studies how every other animal makes a living.</li>
<li><a href="/Mike_Nickerson" title="Mike Nickerson">Mike Nickerson</a> says that "economy is three-fifths of ecology", since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste, which the economy assumes is done "for free".</li>
</ul>

<p>Ecological <a href="/Economic" title="Economic">economics</a> and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others, but it is difficult. Many people think economics is just part of ecology now, and that economics that ignores it is wrong. "Natural <a href="/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a>" is an example of one <a href="/Theory" title="Theory">theory</a> combining both.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology_and_anthropology">Ecology and anthropology</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes ecology is compared to <a href="/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>. Anthropology includes how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment, while ecology includes how our <a href="/Environment" title="Environment">environment</a> is affected by our bodies and minds. There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology, which studies how people interact with the environment. </p>
<p>Antoine de Saint-Exupery stated: "The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books. Because it resists us. Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle".</p>
