<p><a href="/An" title="An">An</a> <b>operating system</b> (or <b>OS</b>) is the name for a group of <a href="/Computer_program" title="Computer program">computer programs</a>, <a href="/Device_driver" title="Device driver">device drivers</a>, <a href="/Kernel_(computer_science)" title="Kernel (computer science)">kernel</a>, and other things that let a <a href="/User" title="User">user</a> work with a <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a>. It can be small (like <a href="/MenuetOS" title="MenuetOS">MenuetOS</a>), or big (like <a href="/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>). Different operating systems can be used for different purposes. Some are used for every day things like on a <a href="/PC" title="PC">personal computer</a>. Others are used for <a href="/Specialize" title="Specialize">specialized</a> work.</p>
<p>An operating system has many jobs. It is responsible for making sure that all the programs can use the <a href="/CPU" title="CPU">CPU</a>, system <a href="/RAM" title="RAM">memory</a>, <a href="/Computer_screen" title="Computer screen">displays</a>, <a href="/Input_device" title="Input device">input devices</a>, and other <a href="/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a>. It also lets the user have a fast, clean, and safe <a href="/Interface" title="Interface">interface</a> so they can do work on the computer. It also talks to other computers or devices on a <a href="/Network" title="Network">network</a>.</p>

<p>The first operating system was used with the <a href="/ENIAC" title="ENIAC">ENIAC</a> (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-pkrz_rutgers"><a href="#_note-pkrz_rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was very hard to make ENIAC do work. How the operating system worked was based on how the <a href="/Switch" title="Switch">switches</a> and <a href="/Cable" title="Cable">cables</a> were put together and depending on this factor <a href="/Punch_card" title="Punch card">punch cards</a> would make a <a href="/Result" title="Result">result</a>. While this was an operating system of a kind, it is not what is thought of as one in modern times.</p>


<p>The first operating system that looked and felt like operating systems in the modern age was <a href="/UNIX" title="UNIX">UNIX</a>, made in 1969 by <a href="/Bell_Labs" title="Bell Labs">Bell Labs</a>. It had a small kernel and many tiny programs that could be put together to work with user <a href="/Information" title="Information">input</a> and <a href="/Data" title="Data">data</a>. Many of its <a href="/Feature" title="Feature">features</a> were taken from <a href="/Multics" title="Multics">Multics</a>, an older operating system made in 1964.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-pkrz_rutgers_b"><a href="#_note-pkrz_rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
