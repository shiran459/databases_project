Some of the oldest remains that we have of ancient people are weapons made of <a href="/Stone" title="Stone">stone</a>. Ancient people also used <a href="/Spear" title="Spear">spears</a>. <a href="/Bow_(weapon)" title="Bow (weapon)">Bows and arrows</a> were in use by about 20,000 <a href="/BC" title="BC">BC</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> During the <a href="/Bronze_age" title="Bronze age">Bronze age</a> people learned to make things of <a href="/Metal" title="Metal">metal</a>, many people used <a href="/Sword" title="Sword">swords</a>. People also built huge machines which could throw rocks to destroy the <a href="/Defensive_wall" title="Defensive wall">defensive walls</a> of enemy cities. Some of these machines were called <a href="/Catapult" title="Catapult">catapults</a> or <a href="/Siege_engine" title="Siege engine">siege engines</a>. Later, <a href="/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> was invented in <a href="/China" title="China">China</a> and the <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europeans</a> began using it to make <a href="/Gun" title="Gun">guns</a> and <a href="/Cannon" title="Cannon">cannons</a>. These weapons were much better than the older weapons, and helped the Europeans to conquer people in many parts of the <a href="/World" title="World">world</a>. People in many parts of the world used guns such as <a href="/Rifle" title="Rifle">rifles</a> and <a href="/Shotgun" title="Shotgun">shotguns</a> for <a href="/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a> animals, and <a href="/Pistol" title="Pistol">handguns</a> for shooting other people.</p> 
<p>People continued to invent new weapons. In 1884 the <a href="/Machine_gun" title="Machine gun">machine gun</a> was invented, which could shoot many <a href="/Bullet" title="Bullet">bullets</a> very fast. <a href="/Soldier" title="Soldier">Soldiers</a> began to use <a href="/Land_mine" title="Land mine">land mines</a>, a bomb hidden in the ground, which <a href="/Explosion" title="Explosion">explodes</a> when someone walks on it.  Small <a href="/Submarine" title="Submarine">submarines</a> were able to use <a href="/Torpedo" title="Torpedo">torpedos</a> to attack bigger ships and hide under the ocean.  When <a href="/Fixed-wing_aircraft" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">airplanes</a> were invented, people began to use them to shoot enemies and to drop <a href="/Bomb" title="Bomb">bombs</a> on them. They built <a href="/Tank" title="Tank">tanks</a> which had big guns and strong <a href="/Armour" title="Armour">armor</a>.  <a href="/Poison_gas" title="Poison gas">Poison gas</a> was used in <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> but was outlawed and rarely used afterwards. </p>
<p>In <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, cities were heavily bombed from the air and <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> used <a href="/V-2" title="V-2">V-2</a> missiles to carry bombs to <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. Both sides used many <a href="/Firebomb" title="Firebomb">firebombs</a>. At the end of World War II, the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> used <a href="/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">atomic bombs</a> (nuclear bombs) to destroy the <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japanese</a> cities of <a href="/Hiroshima" title="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a> and <a href="/Nagasaki" title="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>. </p>


<p>
After World War II, people continued to develop new weapons, including <a href="/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile" title="Intercontinental ballistic missile">intercontinental ballistic missiles</a>. People became concerned about <a href="/Weapon_of_mass_destruction" title="Weapon of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>, weapons that can kill many people very fast, and are usually cheap and easy to make and use. One kind of weapon of mass destruction is <a href="/Poison_gas" title="Poison gas">poison gas</a>. New kinds of poison gas, such as <a href="/Nerve_agent" title="Nerve agent">nerve gas</a>, are much more powerful than the old kinds. Another kind of weapon of mass destruction is <a href="/Biological_warfare" title="Biological warfare">disease germs</a>, which could be used to make many people sick and maybe kill them.  </p>

<p>Old-fashioned weapons still kill many people in wars and fighting. In wars in <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> in the 1990s and early 21st century, many people were killed with <a href="/Machete" title="Machete">machetes</a> (big knives). People sometimes try to make <a href="/Law" title="Law">laws</a>, <a href="/Treaty" title="Treaty">treaties</a>, and <a href="/International" title="International">international</a> <a href="/Agreement" title="Agreement">agreements</a> to try to control weapons because they are worried about all the killing done with them. Laws vary from country to country, for example, in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the "right to keep and bear arms" is guaranteed to all <a href="/Citizenship" title="Citizenship">citizens</a> by the <a href="/United_States_Constitution" title="United States Constitution">Constitution</a>. A country may say that people in that country cannot keep or use guns, or only when the <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> allows it. The <a href="/Laws_of_war" title="Laws of war">laws of war</a> forbid certain weapons, and countries may agree with each other that they should not use certain weapons against each other, or should not have more than a certain number of particular kinds of weapons.</p>
