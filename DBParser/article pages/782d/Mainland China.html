<p><b>Mainland China</b> is the part of <a href="/China" title="China">China</a> not including the Republic of China controlling <a href="/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="/Kinmen" title="Kinmen">Kinmen</a>, <a href="/Matsu" title="Matsu">Matsu</a>, and the <a href="/Pescadores" title="Pescadores">Pescadores</a>.  The term also excludes <a href="/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="/Qing_Dynasty" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>, all of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pescadores, and <a href="/Mongolia" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> were part of the Chinese Empire. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau were given to foreigners for some years (Taiwan to the Japanese, Hong Kong to the <a href="/UK" title="UK">British</a>, and Macau to the <a href="/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a>).</p>
<p>By the end the Qing Empire, China became <a href="/Kuomintang" title="Kuomintang">Nationalist</a> China (the Republic of China) and it got Taiwan back in 1945. After the <a href="/Communist" title="Communist">Communists</a> (the <a href="/People's_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>) took over most of China, the Nationalists kept only Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores.  Mongolia became an <a href="/Independence" title="Independence">independent</a> state later.</p>
<p>Since then, Communist China only includes the part on the <a href="/Continent" title="Continent">continent</a> (mainland) and some small islands that are very near (the largest communist island is <a href="/Hainan" title="Hainan">Hainan</a>). This region is Mainland China.</p>
<p>Later Hong Kong and Macau were returned to the government of China, but because the government calls them "<a href="/Special_administrative_regions" title="Special administrative regions">special administrative regions</a>" under a "one country, two systems" idea, they are still not thought of as part of Mainland China.</p></div>
