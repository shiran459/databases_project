<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_times">Ancient times</span></h3>
<p>Many different tribes lived on the territory of modern Ukraine since pre-historical times. Most historians believe that the Great <a href="/Steppe" title="Steppe">Steppe</a> at the North of the <a href="/Black_Sea" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> was a homeland of all <a href="/Indo-European_languages" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European</a> and <a href="/Indo-Iranian_language" title="Indo-Iranian language">Indo-Iranian languages</a>. Some believe it was also a birthplace of the whole <a href="/Caucasian" title="Caucasian">Caucasian</a> race. Wends, <a href="/Goths" title="Goths">Goths</a>, <a href="/Huns" title="Huns">Huns</a>, Sclaveni, Avars and other tribes and tribal groups fought among themselves, joined unions, terminated and assimilated each other. </p>
<p>By the middle of 4th century AD Antes joined other tribes and established a state under their rule.  Their state fell under the  pressure of  <a href="/Avar" title="Avar">Avars</a> in 602 AD and their name was longer mentioned.  Since the 7th century over 10 tribal groups joined under the name "Slavs" and made their own state named Rus.  The chronicles mention three centers which formed this state: Kuyavia (Kyiv land with Kyiv itself), Slavia (<a href="/Novgorod" title="Novgorod">Novgorod</a> land) and Artania (exact location unknown). </p>
<p>Historians still argue about whether Kyiv was founded by Slavs themselves, or they just captured the <a href="/Khazar" title="Khazar">Khazar</a> fortress which was located on the bank of the <a href="/Dnieper" title="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> river, but since the 10th century, it became the capital of the largest and most powerful state in Europe.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kievan_Rus">Kievan Rus</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Kievan_Rus" title="Kievan Rus">Kievan Rus</a>, the medieval state of Eastern Slavs.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  Established by Slavic with the help of Varangian squads whose force was used to integrate separate tribes and their lands into one powerful state. Varangian princes, who ruled Rus from it first years were gradually assimilated by natives, but the <a href="/Dynasty" title="Dynasty">dynasty</a> started by semy-legendary Ririk survived and continued to govern their separate principalities even after the collapse of Rus. </p>
<p>At an early stage of its existence Rus destroyed such powerful states as the Khazar Khaganate and Old Great <a href="/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>.  Rus princes successfully fought against the <a href="/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, whose emperors had to pay <a href="/Tribute" title="Tribute">tribute</a> to them.  Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities. </p>
<p>In the reign of <a href="/Volodymyr_the_Great" title="Volodymyr the Great">Volodymyr the Great</a> (980-1015) the Kyivan State almost finished its expansion. It occupied the territory from Peipus, <a href="/Lake_Ladoga" title="Lake Ladoga">Ladoga</a> and Onega lakes in the north to the river Don, Ros, Sula, <a href="/Bug_River" title="Bug River">Southern Bug</a> in the south, from the Dniester, the Carpathians, the Neman, Western Dvina River in the west to the Volga and the Oka River in the east, its area became about 800,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Although some of his predecessors already accepted Christianity for themselves, Volodymir decided to convert the entire population of the state to the new religion. Partially with the help of Byzantine missionaries preachers, partly by the brutal violence, he finally made all Kyiv population to be baptized. For this action, the Ukrainian, and later the <a href="/Russian_Orthodox_Church" title="Russian Orthodox Church">Russian Orthodox Churches</a> canonized him under the name of Volodimyr the Baptist.</p>
<p>During the reign of his son, <a href="/Yaroslav_the_Wise" title="Yaroslav the Wise">Yaroslav the Wise</a> (1019–1054), Rus reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power. Rus raised the prestige of Eastern Slavs in Europe, improved the international significance of Kyiv. Rus influenced the political relations in th whole Europe, Western Asia, and in the Middle East. Kyivan princes supported the political, economic, dynastic relations with France, Sweden, England, Poland, Hungary, Norway, Byzantium.</p>
<p>The Rus state also ruled non-Slavic peoples (<a href="/Finno-Ugric" title="Finno-Ugric">Finno-Ugric</a> population of the North, Turkic of the East and South, Balts of the West etc.).  Those peoples gradually assimilated with the Slavs, and with each other, establishing a framework for the future emergence of three new Eastern-Slavic peoples.</p>
<p>The Kyivan State was an eastern outpost of European <a href="/Christendom" title="Christendom">Christendom</a>, it kept the movement of nomad hordes to the West, and reduced their onslaught against Byzantium and Central European countries.</p>
<p>After the death of Mstyslav Volodymyrovych (1132), Rus lost its political unity and finally was divided into 15 principalities and lands. Among them Kyiv, Chernygiv, Volodymyr-Suzdal, <a href="/Novgorod" title="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>, <a href="/Smolensk" title="Smolensk">Smolensk</a>, Polotsk, and Halycian lands and principalities were most large and powerful. </p>
<p>Major political conditions of fragmentation were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The succession among the princes of Kyivan State was different: in some regions lands passed from father to son, in others from the older to the younger brother etc.</li>
<li>The political relationship between individual fiefdoms and private lands was weakened, and the better development of certain lands led to the formation of local separatism;</li>
<li>In some regions the local aristocracy required a strong prince to rule, in order  to protect their rights. On the other hand  while the feudal princes and <a href="/Boyar" title="Boyar">boyars</a> real power increased, and the power of the Grand Prince decreased, more and more of nobles felt priority of their local interests above national ones;</li>
<li>There was not created their own dynasty  in the Kyiv principality, because all the princely families struggled with each other for possession of Kyiv ;</li>
<li>Nomads dramatically intensified their expansion to Kyivan lands.</li>
</ul>

<p>While Kyiv was the center of all social, economic, political, cultural and ideological life in the country for a long time before, other centers have competed with it from the mid-12th century. There were old powers (Novgorod, Smolensk, Polotsk), as well as new ones (Volodymir-on-Klyazma and Halych).</p>
<p>Numerous princely feuds, large and small wars between different lords, were tearing Rus. However, the ancient Ukrainian state did not fell apart.  It only changed form of its government: the personal monarchy was repaced by the federal one, Rus became to be co-ruled by the group of the most influential and powerful princes. Historians call this way of governing "the collective suzerainty." Principality of Kyiv still remained a national center, and the residence of bishops.</p>
<p>In 1206 the new powerful military-feudal Mongolian state headed by Temujin (<a href="/Genghis_Khan" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>) started the war of conquest against his neighbors. In 1223 in the battle near Kalka river 25,000 Tatar-Mongols won a crushing victory over the squads of Southern Rus Princes, who could not come together even in the face of grave danger. Under the leadership of Batu, Genghis Khan's grandson, during the 1237-1238 period they conquered Riazan, Volodymir, Suzdal, and Yaroslavl lands. </p>
<p>In 1240, they attacked Kyiv.  The city was plundered and destroyed. According to the legend, the enemy saved governor Dmytriy's life for his personal courage in the battle. Then Kamenetz, Iziaslav, Volodymyr, Halych lost against invaders.  Batu was able to attach almost all of Rus to his empire, the <a href="/Golden_Horde" title="Golden Horde">Golden Horde</a>, which covered the whole territory from the Urals to the Black Sea,</p>
<p>After the fall of Kyivan State, the political, economic and cultural center of Ukrainian lands was transferred to the Halycian-Volyn Land.  In 1245 Prince Danylo of Halych had to admit his dependence on the <a href="/Golden_Horde" title="Golden Horde">Golden Horde</a>.  Hoping to get help from Catholic Europe in his the struggle for independence, he also made a secret alliance with Poland, Hungary, Masovia and the <a href="/Teutonic_Knights" title="Teutonic Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>.  In 1253 he received  the crown from Pope Innocent IV and became a King of Rus. In 1259, due to the lack of military aid from the West, the king was forced to re-recognize the supremacy of the Horde. His successor, Lev I had to take part in theTartar campaigns against Poland and Lithuania. </p>
<p>In 1308 the government moved to Danylo's grandchildren - Andrew and Lev II, who started the new struggle against the Golden Horde allied with the Teutonic knights and princes of Mazowia. However, after their death the last monarch Yuri II again had to claim himself as the Golden Horde vassal. He was murdered in 1340 and his death gave the rise to Poland and Lithuania (the neighbors who had a  dynastic right for the throne of Rus) to start a war for the Halycian-Volyn heritage. In 1392 Galicia, with Belz and Chelm Lands were finally icorporated to the Kingdom of Poland and Volhynia to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</p>
<p>At the end of the 14th century, Ukrainian territories were divided between different states. Lithuania seized Kyiv, Chernihiv and Volyn Lands. Poland ruled in Halycian and Podolian. The Southern Ukraine was under the rule of the Crimean Khanate (formed in 1447) and the Eastern under the power of Muscovy. In 1569 Lithuania and Poland merged to the united state called Commonwealth (Polish: Rzecypospolyta) to deal with neighbors, as a result, the central Ukrainian lands of Lithuania came under Polish control.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h4>
<p>Rus, or The Kyivan State, Latin: Ruthenia, Greek: Ρωσία; often misspeled as "Kievan State" or even "Kievan Rus", using Russian spelling of its capital Kyiv (Russian: Киев [ˈkiɛf]). </p>
<p>As for the origin and definition of the name "Rus" there is no consensus among researchers. Several versions exist:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Normans" title="Normans">Normans</a> (<a href="/Vikings" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>) tribes who called themselves Ruses and founded a state among Slavs, which naturally was called 'Rus Land'.
