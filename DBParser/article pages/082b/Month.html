<p>A <b>month</b> is an amount of <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a> used with <a href="/Calendar" title="Calendar">calendars</a>. It is about one twelfth of a year. It is a little longer than a natural <a href="/Period" title="Period">period</a> of the <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">moon</a>, 29.53 <a href="/Day" title="Day">days</a>. In some cultures, the idea for months came from <a href="/Moon_phase" title="Moon phase">moon phases</a>. People have counted days based on moon phases for a very long time. Months of some calendars are still strongly based on the moon. These are called "lunar calendars". </p>
<p>Others, called "solar calendars", ignore the moon, and depend entirely on the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> â€” for example, the <a href="/Gregorian_calendar" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> of 365 or 366 days (twelve months) used in much of the world today.</p>
