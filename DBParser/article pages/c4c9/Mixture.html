<p>In <a href="/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, a <b>mixture</b> is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler <a href="/Substance" title="Substance">substance</a>s. These substances be <a href="/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">chemical elements</a> or <a href="/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">compounds</a>. A mixture can be made of <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a>, <a href="/Solid" title="Solid">solids</a>, or <a href="/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a>.</p>
<p>A mixture is not the same as a <a href="/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">compound</a> which is made of two or more <a href="/Atom" title="Atom">atoms</a> connected together.  For instance, a mixture of the gases <a href="/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound <a href="/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.</p>
<p>A mixture where the different parts can be distinguished easily is called <i>heterogenous</i>, one where this is not the case is called <i>homogeneous</i>. A third form is called <a href="/Colloid" title="Colloid">colloid</a>. </p>
<p>If one substance in a mixture <a href="/Dissolution" title="Dissolution">dissolves</a> in the other, it is called a <a href="/Solution" title="Solution">solution</a>. For example if <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> is put in water it forms a mixture, then dissolves to make a solution. If it does not dissolve, it would be called a <a href="/Suspension_(chemistry)" title="Suspension (chemistry)">suspension</a>.</p>
<p>Solids can be mixtures also.  Many kinds of <a href="/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> and <a href="/Mineral" title="Mineral">rock</a> are mixtures of different <a href="/Mineral" title="Mineral">minerals</a>.</p>
