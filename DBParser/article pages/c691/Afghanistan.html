The Hazaras live in the mountains of central Afghanistan, many people believe that they have connection to the 13th century <a href="/Mongol" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> invaders, because their language has many Mongol words.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ngk_c"><a href="#_note-ngk" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pashto and Dari are the official languages of Afghanistan; bilingualism is very common.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-AO_b"><a href="#_note-AO" title="">[1]</a></sup> Both are <a href="/Indo-European_language" title="Indo-European language">Indo-European languages</a> from the <a href="/Iranian_languages" title="Iranian languages">Iranian languages</a> sub-family.

<p>Afghanistan is a largely <a href="/Rural" title="Rural">rural</a> country, which means that there are only few major cities and much spaced-apart land. Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities. <a href="/Kabul" title="Kabul">Kabul</a>, the capital, is the largest city. It is along the <a href="/Kabul_River" title="Kabul River">Kabul River</a> south of the <a href="/Hindu_Kush" title="Hindu Kush">Hindu Kush</a> range.

The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers. The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings. Some Afghan people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest. Millions of people escaped from Afghanistan in order to not get involved in the wars that happened in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

<p>Afghanistan was recognized as <i>Khorasan</i>, meaning "land of the rising sun," which was a prosperous and independent geographic region reaching as far as the Indus River.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EI"><a href="#_note-EI" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Britannica"><a href="#_note-Britannica" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>All the major cities of modern Afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past. The New Persian <a href="/Literature" title="Literature">literature</a> arose and flourished in the area. The early Persian poets such as <a href="/Rudaki" title="Rudaki">Rudaki</a> were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover, <a href="/Ferdowsi" title="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</a>, the author of <a href="/Shahnameh" title="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>, the national <a href="/Epic_poetry" title="Epic poetry">epic</a> of Iran, and <a href="/Rumi" title="Rumi">Rumi</a>, the famous <a href="/Sufi" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> poet, were also from modern-day Afghanistan. It has produced scientists such as <a href="/Avicenna" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>, <a href="/Al-Farabi" title="Al-Farabi">Al-Farabi</a>, <a href="/Al-Biruni" title="Al-Biruni">Al-Biruni</a>, <a href="/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m" title="Omar Khayyám">Omar Khayyám</a>, <a href="/Al-Khwarizmi" title="Al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a>, and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="/Astronomy" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>, <a href="/Geography" title="Geography">geography</a>, and <a href="/Geology" title="Geology">geology</a>. It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating <a href="/Mongol" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> invasion in the 13th century.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-35"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/Timur" title="Timur">Timur</a>, the Turkic conqueror, took over in the end of the 14th century and began to rebuild cities in this region. Timur's successors, the <a href="/Timurids" title="Timurids">Timurids</a> (1405–1507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Herat with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Between south of the Hindu Kush and the Indus River (today's Pakistan) was the native land of the Afghan tribes. They called this land "Afghanistan" (meaning "land of the Afghans"). The Afghans ruled the rich northern Indian subcontinent with their capital at <a href="/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>. From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was disputed between the <a href="/Safavid_dynasty" title="Safavid dynasty">Safavids</a> of <a href="/Isfahan" title="Isfahan">Isfahan</a> and the <a href="/Mughal_Empire" title="Mughal Empire">Mughals</a> of <a href="/Agra" title="Agra">Agra</a> who had replaced the <a href="/Lodi_dynasty" title="Lodi dynasty">Lodi</a> and <a href="/Sur_Empire" title="Sur Empire">Suri</a> Afghan rulers in India. The Safavids and Mughals occasionally oppressed the native Afghans but at the same time the Afghans used each empire to punish the other. In 1709, the <a href="/Hotaki_dynasty" title="Hotaki dynasty">Hotaki</a> Afghans rose to power and completely defeated the Persian Empire. Then they marched towards the Mughals of India and nominally defeated them with the help of the Afsharid forces under Nader Shah Afshar.</p>
<p>In 1747, after Nader Shah of Persia was killed, a great leader named <a href="/Ahmad_Shah_Durrani" title="Ahmad Shah Durrani">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a> united all the different Muslim tribes and established the Afghan Empire (<a href="/Durrani_Empire" title="Durrani Empire">Durrani Empire</a>). He is considered the founding father of the modern state of Afghanistan<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ReferenceA_b"><a href="#_note-ReferenceA" title="">[20]</a></sup> while <a href="/Mirwais_Hotak" title="Mirwais Hotak">Mirwais Hotak</a> is the grandfather of the nation.</p>

<p>During the 1800s, Afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires, <a href="/British_India" title="British India">British India</a> and <a href="/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russia</a>. As British India advanced into Afghanistan, Russia felt threatened and expanded southward across Central Asia. To stop the Russian advance, Britain tried to make Afghanistan part of its empire but the Afghans fought wars with British-led Indians from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880. After the third war in 1919, Afghanistan under <a href="/Amanullah_Khan" title="Amanullah Khan">King Amanullah</a> gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Afghanistan was a <a href="/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> established in 1926. It was the successor state to the <a href="/Emirate_of_Afghanistan" title="Emirate of Afghanistan">Emirate of Afghanistan</a>. On 27 September 1934, during the reign of Zahir Shah, the Kingdom of Afghanistan joined the <a href="/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>.  During <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Afghanistan remained neutral. It pursued a <a href="/Diplomacy" title="Diplomacy">diplomatic policy</a> of non-alignment.</p>
<p>The creation of Pakistan in 1947 as its eastern neighbor created problems. In 1973, political crises led to the overthrow of the king. The country's new leader ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a <a href="/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a>. In 1978, a <a href="/Communist" title="Communist">Communist</a> political party supported by the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> seized control of Afghanistan's government. This move sparked rebellions throughout the country. The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance. The Soviets took advantage of the situation and <a href="/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan" title="Soviet war in Afghanistan">invaded Afghanistan in December 1979</a>.</p>
<p>Most people in Afghanistan opposed the sudden Soviet presence in their country. For nearly a decade, anti-Communist Islamic forces known as <i>Mujahideen</i> were trained inside neighboring Pakistan to fight the Soviets and the Afghan government. The <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and other anti-Soviet countries supported the Mujahideen. In the long war, over one million Afghan civilians were killed. The Soviet Army also lost more than 15,000 soldiers in that war. Millions of Afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops.
</p>


<p>
After the Soviets left, different Afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country. The warlords received support from other countries, including neighboring Pakistan and Iran. A very conservative <a href="/Islamic" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> group known as the <a href="/Taliban" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> emerged in an attempt to end the civil war. By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over 95% of Afghanistan. A group known as the Northern Alliance, based in northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan, continued to fight against the Taliban.

<p>
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of <a href="/Islamic_law" title="Islamic law">Islamic law</a>. People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments. In addition, the Taliban completely restricted the rights of women. Because of such policies, most countries refused to recognize the Taliban government. Only <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and the <a href="/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE) accepted them as the official government.</p>
<p>The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected <a href="/Terrorist" title="Terrorist">terrorists</a> to live freely in Afghanistan. Among them were <a href="/Osama_bin_Laden" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> and members of the <a href="/Al-Qaeda" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> terrorist network. In September 2001, the United States blamed bin Laden for the <a href="/September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.</a> The Taliban refused to hand him over to the United States. In response, the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against al-Qaeda in October 2001. Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul, and a new government led by <a href="/Hamid_Karzai" title="Hamid Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> came to power, but fighting between the Taliban and US-led armies continued.  Taliban fighters have gone into Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan.  Afghans accuse Pakistan's military of being behind the Taliban militants but Pakistan has rejected this and stated that a stable Afghanistan is in Pakistan's own interest.</p>
<p>In December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democratically</a> elected president of Afghanistan.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-cia_c"><a href="#_note-cia" title="">[10]</a></sup> <a href="/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a> began rebuilding Afghanistan, including its military and government institutions.  Many schools and colleges were built.  Freedom for women has improved. Women can study, work, drive, and run for office.  Many Afghan women work as politicians, some are ministers while at least one is a mayor.  Others have opened businesses, or joined the military or police. Afghanistan's economy has also improved dramatically, and NATO agreed in 2012 to help the country for at least another 10 years after 2014.  In the meantime, Afghanistan improved diplomatic ties with many countries in the world and continues.</p>
