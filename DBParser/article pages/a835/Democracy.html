<p>A <b>democracy</b> means <i>rule by the people</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The name is used for different forms of <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a>, where the people can take part in the decisions that affect the way their <a href="/Community" title="Community">community</a> is run. In modern times, there are different ways this can be done:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The people  meet to decide about new <a href="/Laws" title="Laws">laws</a>, and changes to existing ones. This is usually called <b>direct democracy</b>.</li>
<li>The people elect their leaders. These leaders take this decision about laws. This is commonly called <b>representative democracy</b>. The process of choosing is called <a href="/Election" title="Election">election</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Elections are either held periodically, or when an officeholder dies. </li>
<li>Sometimes people can propose new laws or changes to existing laws. Usually, this is done using a <a href="/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendum</a>, which needs a certain number of supporters.</li>
<li>The people who make the decisions are chosen more or less at random. This is common, for example when choosing a <a href="/Jury" title="Jury">jury</a> for a <a href="/Trial" title="Trial">trial</a>. This method is known as sortition or <a href="/Allotment" title="Allotment">allotment</a>. In  a trial, the jury will have to decide the question whether the person is guilty or not. In Europe, trials with a jury are only used for serious crimes, such as <a href="/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a>, <a href="/Hostage" title="Hostage">hostage</a> taking or <a href="/Arson" title="Arson">arson</a>.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Elections">Elections</span></h2>
<p>After people hold an election, the candidates that won are determined. The way this is done can be simple: The candidate with the most votes gets elected. Very often, the <a href="/Politician" title="Politician">politicians</a> being elected belong to a <a href="/Political_party" title="Political party">political party</a>. Instead of choosing a person, people vote for a party. The party with the most votes then picks the candidates. </p>
<p>Usually, the people being elected need to meet certain conditions: They need to have a certain <a href="/Ageing" title="Ageing">age</a> or a government body needs to determine that they are suitably qualified to perform the job. </p>
<p>Not everyone can vote in an election. <a href="/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">Suffrage</a> is only given to people who are citizens. Some groups may be excluded, for example <a href="/Prisoner" title="Prisoner">prisoners</a>. </p>
<p>For some elections, a country may make voting <a href="/Compulsory_voting" title="Compulsory voting">compulsory</a>. Someone who does not vote, and who does not give a good reason usually has to pay a <a href="/Fine" title="Fine">fine</a>.

<p>Democracy may be direct or indirect.</p>
<p>In a <a href="/Direct_democracy" title="Direct democracy">direct democracy</a>, everyone has the right to make laws together. One modern example of direct democracy is a <a href="/Referendum" title="Referendum">referendum</a>, which is the <a href="/Name" title="Name">name</a> for the kind of way to pass a law where everyone in the community votes on it. Direct democracies are not usually used to run countries, because it is hard to get millions of people to get together all the time to make laws and other decisions. There is not enough time.</p>
<p>In an <a href="/Indirect_democracy" title="Indirect democracy">indirect</a>, or representative democracy, people choose representatives to make laws for them. These people can be mayors, councilmen, members of Parliament, or other government officials. This is a much more common kind of democracy. Large communities like cities and countries use this method, but it may not be needed for a small group.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_origins">Ancient origins</span></h3>
<p>This kind of government was developed long ago by the ancient <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> in the city of <a href="/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>. They had everyone who was a <a href="/Citizen" title="Citizen">citizen</a> (<a href="/Slave" title="Slave">slaves</a>, <a href="/Woman" title="Woman">women</a>, foreigners, and children could not vote) get together in one area. The Assembly would talk about what kinds of laws they wanted and voted on them. The Council would suggest the laws. All citizens were allowed in the Assembly. </p>
<p>The Council were picked by draws (<a href="/Lottery" title="Lottery">lottery</a>). The participants in the Council would change every <a href="/Year" title="Year">year</a> and the number of people in the Council was at the most 500. For some offices the Athenian citizens would pick a leader by writing the name of their favorite <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/candidate">candidate</a> on a piece of <a href="/Stone" title="Stone">stone</a> or <a href="/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a>. The person with the most votes became the <a href="/Leader" title="Leader">leader</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>In the Middle Ages, there were many systems in which there were elections, although only a few people could join in at this time. The <a href="/Parliament_of_England" title="Parliament of England">Parliament of England</a> began from the <a href="/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>, a document which showed that the King's power was limited, and protected certain rights of the people. The first elected parliament was De Montfort's Parliament in England in 1265.</p>
<p>However, only a few people could actually join in. Parliament was chosen by only a few percent of the people (in 1780, less than 3% of people joined in).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-nationalarchives"><a href="#_note-nationalarchives" title="">[4]</a></sup> The ruler also had the power to call parliaments. After a long time, the power of Parliament began to grow. After the <a href="/Glorious_Revolution" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688, the English Bill of Rights made Parliament more powerful.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-nationalarchives_b"><a href="#_note-nationalarchives" title="">[4]</a></sup> Later, the ruler became a <a href="/Symbol" title="Symbol">symbol</a> instead of having real power.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
