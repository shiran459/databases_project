<dd><i>Some types of <a href="/Distillation" title="Distillation">distilled</a> <a href="/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcoholic</a> <a href="/Drink" title="Drink">drinks</a> are also called <b>spirits</b> (as a plural, not "</i>spirit<i>").</i></dd>
</dl>

<p>A <b>spirit</b> is considered to be the part of a <a href="/Being" title="Being">being</a> that is not the body. Other words with the same meanings are <a href="/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a> and <a href="/Ghost" title="Ghost">ghost</a>. When a body is alive, it has a spirit in it. <a href="/Death" title="Death">Death</a> is when the spirit separates from the body. </p>
<p><a href="/Christian" title="Christian">Christians</a> believe that spirits exist in <a href="/Heaven" title="Heaven">Heaven</a> or <a href="/Hell" title="Hell">Hell</a>. (See <a href="/1_Timothy" title="1 Timothy">1 Timothy</a> 3:16, 4:1) </p>
<p><a href="/Spiritual_s%C3%A9ance" title="Spiritual sÃ©ance">Spiritualists</a> believe that spirits can talk with people, or change things in the world. Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way, (see <a href="/Leviticus" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 19:31) but a few include this as part of their practice.</p>
<p>Another use of <i>spirit</i> means the main purpose or <a href="/Definition" title="Definition">meaning</a> of a sentence or <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/document">document</a>. For example, the "spirit of a <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a>" is the true meaning of the law which the creator wanted. This phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing, but a <a href="/Judge" title="Judge">judge</a> must decide what meaning is correct.</p>
