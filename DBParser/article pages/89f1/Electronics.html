<b>Electronics</b> is the study of how to control the flow of <a href="/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a>. It deals with <a href="/Electrical_circuit" title="Electrical circuit">circuits</a> made up of <a href="/Electronic_component" title="Electronic component">components</a> that control the flow of <a href="/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>. Electronics is a part of <a href="/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> and <a href="/Electrical_engineering" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a>.</p>
<p>Electrical components like transistors and relays can act as switches. This lets us use electrical circuits to <a href="/Signal_processing" title="Signal processing">process information</a> and <a href="/Telecommunication" title="Telecommunication">transmit information across long distances</a>. Circuits can also take a weak signal (like a whisper) and amplify it (make it louder).</p>
<p>Most electronic systems fall into two categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Processing and distribution of information. These are called <a href="/Communications_system" title="Communications system">communications systems</a>.</li>
<li>Conversion and distribution of energy. These are called <a href="/Control_system" title="Control system">control systems</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way of looking at an <a href="/Electronic_system" title="Electronic system">electronic system</a> is to separate it into three parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Inputs - Electrical or mechanical <a href="/Sensor" title="Sensor">sensors</a>, which take <a href="/Signal_(electrical_engineering)" title="Signal (electrical engineering)">signals</a> from the physical world (in the form of temperature, pressure, etc.) and convert them into electric current and voltage signals.</li>
<li>Signal processing circuits - These consist of electronic components connected together to manipulate, interpret and transform the information contained in the signals.</li>
<li>Outputs - <a href="/Actuator" title="Actuator">Actuators</a> or other devices that transform current and voltage signals back into human readable information.</li>
</ol>

<p>A <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a> set, for example, has as its input a <a href="/Broadcast" title="Broadcast">broadcast</a> signal received from an <a href="/Antenna" title="Antenna">antenna</a>, or for <a href="/Cable_television" title="Cable television">cable television</a>, a cable. </p>
<p>Signal processing circuits inside the television set use the <a href="/Brightness" title="Brightness">brightness</a>, <a href="/Colour" title="Colour">colour</a>, and <a href="/Sound" title="Sound">sound</a> information contained in the received signal to control the television set's output devices. The display output device may be a <a href="/Cathode_ray_tube" title="Cathode ray tube">cathode ray tube</a> (CRT) or a <a href="/Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> or <a href="/Liquid_crystal_display" title="Liquid crystal display">liquid crystal display</a> screen. The audio output device might be a <a href="/Magnetic" title="Magnetic">magnetically</a> driven audio <a href="/Loudspeaker" title="Loudspeaker">speaker</a>. The display output devices convert the signal processing circuits' brightness and colour information into the visible <a href="/Image" title="Image">image</a> displayed on a screen. The audio output device converts the processed sound information into sounds that can be heard by listeners.</p>
<p>Analysis of a <a href="/Electrical_circuit" title="Electrical circuit">circuit</a>/<a href="/Network" title="Network">network</a> involves knowing the input and the signal processing circuit, and finding out the output. Knowing the input and output and finding out or <a href="/Circuit_design" title="Circuit design">designing</a> the signal processing part is called <i><a href="/Synthesis" title="Synthesis">synthesis</a></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>People started experimenting with electricity as early as 600 B.C.E, when <a href="/Thales" title="Thales">Thales of Miletus</a> discovered rubbing <a href="/Fur" title="Fur">fur</a> on <a href="/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a> would cause them to attract each other.</p>
<p>Devices used in the 1900's used glass or metal <a href="/Vacuum" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a> <a href="/Vacuum_tube" title="Vacuum tube">tubes</a> to control the flow of electricity. With these components a low power voltage can be used to change another, and that's why they are useful in amplifiers and switches.</p>
<p>By the late 1960's and early 1970's the <a href="/Transistor" title="Transistor">transistor</a> and <a href="/Semiconductor" title="Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> began replacing vacuum tubes. Transistors can be made much smaller than vacuum tubes and they can work using less energy.</p>
<p>At about the same time, <a href="/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuits</a> (circuits that have a large numbers of very small transistors placed on very thin slices of <a href="/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a>) became commonly used. Integrated circuits made it possible to reduce the number of parts needed to make electronic products and made the products much cheaper in general.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Analog_circuits">Analog circuits</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Analog_signal" title="Analog signal">Analog</a> circuits are used for signals that have a range of <a href="/Amplitude" title="Amplitude">amplitudes</a>. In general, analog circuits measure or control the amplitude of signals. In the early days of electronics, all electronic devices used analog circuits. The <a href="/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a> of the analog circuit is often measured or controlled in analog signal processing. Even though digital circuits are used more often, analog circuits will always be necessary.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pulse_circuits">Pulse circuits</span></h2>
<p>Pulse circuits are used for signals that require rapid pulses of energy. For example, <a href="/Aircraft" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> and ground <a href="/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a> equipment work by using pulse circuits to create and send high powered bursts of radio energy from radar <a href="/Transmitter" title="Transmitter">transmitters</a>. Special antennas (called "beam" or "dish" antennas because of their shape) are used to send ("transmit") the high powered bursts in the direction the beam or dish antenna is pointed.</p>
<p>The radar transmitter's pulses or bursts of radio energy hit and bounce back (they are "reflected") from hard and metallic objects. Hard objects are things like buildings, hills, and mountains. Metallic objects are anything made of metal, like aircraft, bridges, or even objects in space, like <a href="/Satellite_(artificial)" title="Satellite (artificial)">satellites</a>. The reflected radar energy is detected by radar pulse <a href="/Receiver" title="Receiver">receivers</a> which use both pulse and digital circuits together. The pulse and digital circuits in radar pulse receivers are used to show the location and distance of objects which have reflected the radar transmitter's high powered pulses.</p>
<p>By controlling how often the rapid pulses of radar energy are sent out by a radar transmitter (called the transmitter's "pulse timing"), and how long it takes for the reflected pulse energy to come back to the radar receiver, one can tell not only where objects are, but also how far away they are. Digital circuits in a radar receiver calculate the distance to an object by knowing the time interval between energy pulses. The radar receiver's digital circuits count how long it takes between pulses for an object's reflected energy to be detected by the radar receiver. Since radar pulses are sent and received at approximately the <a href="/Speed_of_light" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>, the distance to an object can easily be calculated. This is done in digital circuits by multiplying the speed of light by the time it takes to receive the radar energy reflected back from an object.</p>
<p>The time between pulses (often called "pulse rate time", or PRT) sets the limit on how far away an object can be detected. That distance is called the "range" of a radar transmitter and receiver. Radar transmitters and receivers use long PRT's to find the distance to objects that are far away. Long PRT's makes it possible to accurately determine the distance to the moon, for example. Fast PRT's are used to detect objects that are much closer, like ships at sea, high flying aircraft, or to determine the speed of fast moving automobiles on highways.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Digital_circuits">Digital circuits</span></h2>


<p>
Digital circuits are used for signals that only turn on and off instead of often working at levels somewhere between on and off. Active components in digital circuits typically have one signal level when turned on, and another signal level when turned off. In general, in digital circuits a component is only switched on and off. </p>
