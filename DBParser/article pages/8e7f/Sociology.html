<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_do_sociologists_do.3F">What do sociologists do?</span></h2>

<p>Sociologists research the structures that organize society, such as race, <a href="/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a> (whether a person is male or female), and <a href="/Social_class" title="Social class">social classes</a> (rich or poor). They study the family and examine problems such as crime and drug abuse.</p>
<p>Most sociologists work in one or more specialty areas or "sub-fields". Sociology includes many sub-fields that examine different aspects of society. For example, social stratification studies inequality and class structure in society. The field of demography studies changes in a population size or type. The field of criminology examines criminal behavior and crime. Political sociology studies government and laws. Sociology of race and sociology of gender examine how people think about race and gender.</p>
<p>Many sociologists also do research outside of the university. Their research helps teachers, lawmakers, and government administrators to make better institutions, government programs, and rules.</p>
<p>Sociologists often use <a href="/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a> to count and measure patterns in how people act or behave. Sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways. Some sociologists combine different research methods.</p>
