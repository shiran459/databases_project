The word "<b>information</b>" is used in many different ways. Originally, it comes from a word that meant to give a <a href="/Form" title="Form">form</a> to something. Information  is something that people can <a href="/Learn" title="Learn">learn</a>, <a href="/Know" title="Know">know</a> about, or <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/understand">understand</a>. For example, a <a href="/Newspaper" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> contains information about the <a href="/World" title="World">world</a>. This article contains information about "Information".</p>

<p>People who use <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a> often use the words <i>information</i> and <i><a href="/Data" title="Data">data</a></i> in the same way. There are special fields of study called "<a href="/Information_science" title="Information science">information science</a>" and "<a href="/Information_technology" title="Information technology">information technology</a>" (IT).</p>
<p>In the <a href="/1970s" title="1970s">1970s</a> and <a href="/1980s" title="1980s">1980s</a>, some people gave a new, specific meaning to "information". At that time, the first <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> <a href="/Database" title="Database">databases</a> were built. In <a href="/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, <i>data</i> often means a kind of information that has not been checked. That means <i>data</i> has not been changed or fixed, and you may not be able to trust it. With the new meaning, <i>information</i> means data that has been checked and passed tests for what it must be. A person can <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trust">trust</a> that "information" is <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/correct">correct</a>.</p>
<p>Information can only be correct and good enough to trust if there are very good and complete ways to check the data (data checking, <a href="/Validation" title="Validation">validation</a> or <a href="/Verification" title="Verification">verification</a>) and decide it is good enough (<a href="/Acceptance" title="Acceptance">acceptance</a> process).  A person must know rules were used to check the data or trust the person who checked the data.  If a person cannot tell that this was done, the information still seems to be data for that person, so that person must check the data again, in that general view about data.</p>
