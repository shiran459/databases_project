A <b>cube</b> is a block with all <a href="/Right_angle" title="Right angle">right angles</a> and whose <a href="/Height" title="Height">height</a>, <a href="/Width" title="Width">width</a> and <a href="/Depth" title="Depth">depth</a> are all the same. </p>
<p>A cube is one of the simplest <a href="/Platonic_solid" title="Platonic solid">mathematical shapes</a> in space. Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as <i>cubic</i>.</p>

<p>The basic difference between a cube and a <a href="/Square_(geometry)" title="Square (geometry)">square</a> is, a cube is a <a href="/3D" title="3D">3D</a> figure (having 3 <a href="/Dimension" title="Dimension">dimensions</a>) i.e. length, breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e. length and breadth.
The 2-dimensional (<a href="/2D" title="2D">2D</a>) shape (like a circle, square, triangle, etc.) that a cube is made of is <a href="/Square_(geometry)" title="Square (geometry)">squares</a>. The sides (faces) of a cube are squares. The edges are straight <a href="/Line" title="Line">lines</a>. The corners (vertices) are at right angles.  A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges and 6 faces, as in the most usual kind of <a href="/Dice" title="Dice">dice</a>.  A <a href="/Tesseract" title="Tesseract">tesseract</a> carries this idea into the fourth dimension (<a href="/4D" title="4D">4D</a>) and is made of 8 cubes.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/Volume" title="Volume">volume</a> of a cube is the <a href="/Length" title="Length">length</a> of any one of the edges (they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used) <i>cubed</i>. </li>
<li>This means you multiply the number by itself, and then by itself again. </li>
<li>If the edge is named 'd' (See Diagram), the equation would be this: Volume=d×d×d (or Volume=d<sup>3</sup>).</li>
</ul>
