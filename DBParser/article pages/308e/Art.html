<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_.22art.22_means">What "art" means</span></h2>
<p>Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the <a href="/Mind" title="Mind">human mind</a>, <a href="/Spirit" title="Spirit">spirit</a> and <a href="/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a>.  An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it.</p>
<p>The first and broadest sense of "art" means "arrangement" or "to arrange." In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design. </p>
<p>Art may express <a href="/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotion</a>.  Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an <a href="/Audience" title="Audience">audience</a>.  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_art">History of art</span></h2>

<p>There are sculptures, <a href="/Cave_painting" title="Cave painting">cave painting</a> and <a href="/Rock_art" title="Rock art">rock art</a> dating from the Upper <a href="/Paleolithic" title="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> era.</p>
<p>All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> or <a href="/Arabia" title="Arabia">Arabia</a> had works and styles of art. In the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, most of the art in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> showed people from the <a href="/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> in <a href="/Painting" title="Painting">paintings</a>, <a href="/Stained_glass" title="Stained glass">stained glass</a> windows, and <a href="/Mosaic" title="Mosaic">mosaic</a> tile floors and walls.</p>
<p><a href="/Islamic" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> art includes <a href="/Geometric" title="Geometric">geometric</a> patterns, Islamic <a href="/Calligraphy" title="Calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, and <a href="/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a>. In <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> and <a href="/Tibet" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included <a href="/Jade" title="Jade">jade</a> carving, bronzework, <a href="/Pottery" title="Pottery">pottery</a>, <a href="/Poetry" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.</p>
<p>In Europe, after the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, there was a "<a href="/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>" which means "rebirth". People rediscovered <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a> and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like <a href="/Michelangelo" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> and <a href="/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented <a href="/Perspective_(graphical)" title="Perspective (graphical)">perspective</a> where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to <a href="/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">Modernity</a> created many new painting styles such as <a href="/Classicism" title="Classicism">Classicism</a>, <a href="/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, <a href="/Realism" title="Realism">Realism</a>, and <a href="/Impressionism" title="Impressionism">Impressionism</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Roles_of_art">Roles of art</span></h2>

<p>In some <a href="/Society" title="Society">societies</a>, people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her "<a href="/Talent" title="Talent">talent</a>" into the art. In this view, the art is the <a href="/Property" title="Property">property</a> of the artist.</p>
<p>In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its <a href="/Social_capital" title="Social capital">social capital</a> into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a <a href="/Collective" title="Collective">collective</a> that has made the art, through the artist.</p>
