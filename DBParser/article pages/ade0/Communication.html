<p>
<b>Communication</b> is when <a href="/Information" title="Information">information</a> is passed from a sender to a recipient using a <a href="/Media" title="Media">medium</a>. There are different media that can be used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual communication (using <a href="/Body_language" title="Body language">body language</a> or <a href="/Gesture" title="Gesture">gestures</a>)</li>
<li>Communicating with <a href="/Sound" title="Sound">sounds</a> (like human <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a>, but may also be the barking of a <a href="/Dog" title="Dog">dog</a>)</li>
<li>Communication using <a href="/Touch" title="Touch">touch</a></li>
<li>Using <a href="/Olfaction" title="Olfaction">smell</a></li>
<li>Using <a href="/Writing" title="Writing">writing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Communication can be good <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/speak">spoken</a> (a word) or non-spoken (a <a href="/Smile" title="Smile">smile</a>). Communication has many ways, and happens all the time. Not only humans communicate, most other animals do too. Some communication is done without thinking, such as by changing in <a href="/Nonverbal_communication" title="Nonverbal communication">posture</a>.</p>
<p>Communication that tries to change somebody's mind may be called <a href="/Persuasion" title="Persuasion">persuasion</a> or <a href="/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a>.</p>


<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_communication_works">How communication works</span></h2>
<p>Communication works by exchanging information or messages. In very basic terms
</p>
<ol>
<li>The sender makes a message, from an idea. This is usually called <i>encoding</i></li>
<li>The sender transmits the message through the medium.</li>
<li>The recipient receives the message and <i>decodes</i> it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Besides the content of the message, there are other things that are important. These are not part of the message itself, but rather of its <a href="/Context" title="Context">context</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is communicating, and what status does the communicator have.</li>
<li>Communication messages usually do not come alone, but are accompanied by other messages. These are also interpreted.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a message exchange to be successful, the sender and the recipient must have agreed on a vocabulary. The word <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hedge">hedge</a></i> can mean completely different things based on the context. In <a href="/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> a hedge is a row of <a href="/Shrub" title="Shrub">shrubs</a> or <a href="/Tree" title="Tree">trees</a> that make a barrier or form a <a href="/Border" title="Border">border</a>. In <a href="/Finance" title="Finance">finance</a>, a hedge is an <a href="/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> made to reduce the <a href="/Risk" title="Risk">risk</a> of another investment. In <a href="/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a> a hedge is a word or set of words that make other words less important. Without any information it is therefore very difficult to know which <i>hedge</i> is really meant by the speaker.</p>
