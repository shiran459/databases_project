<p>A <b>sphere</b> is a <a href="/Shape" title="Shape">shape</a> in space that is like the <a href="/Surface" title="Surface">surface</a> of a <a href="/Ball" title="Ball">ball</a>. Most of the time, the terms ball and sphere are used as the same. But in <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, the precise (exact) definition only allows points in the 3 dimensional space which are uniformly and symmetrically located at a fixed length called radius of the sphere.</p>
<p>Examples of these are basketballs, superballs, and playground balls.</p>
<p>A sphere is the 3 dimensional analogue of a circle.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Volume">Volume</span></h2>

<p>The volume (V) of a sphere is given by the following formula
</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="math">\!V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</span></dd>
</dl>

<p>where <i>r</i> is the radius of the sphere.
</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Surface_area">Surface area</span></h2>

<p>The surface area (A) of a sphere is given by the following formula</p>

<dl>
<dd><span class="math">\!A =4 \pi r^2</span></dd>
</dl>

<p>where <i>r</i> is the radius of the sphere.</p>

<p>In Cartesian co-ordinates, the equation for a sphere with a center at (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>) is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math">(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2</span></p>
<p>where r is the radius of the sphere.</p>
