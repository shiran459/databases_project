<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ethnicity">Ethnicity</span></h2>
<p>Most people in Norway are ethnic Norwegians. They speak a language that is related to German and English. Swedish and Danish are so close to Norwegian that most Norwegians understand them. Across Norway, many different dialects are spoken. Norwegians disagree on how to make one correct written language. Therefore, there are two standard languages, Bokmål and Nynorsk. Nynorsk is used in writing in most of the western areas and in the central mountains. Bokmål is written by most people in the rest of the country. </p>
<p>A native population of Norway, the <a href="/Sami_people" title="Sami people">Sami people</a>, has its home in the northern parts of the country. Their language is not at all related to Norwegian. In some parishes in the far north, they make up the majority of people. Many Sami now live outside the Sami homeland, mostly in Oslo and other big cities. Earlier, Sami people were forced to speak Norwegian in school. Now Sami is taught as the first language in school for Sami children, and Norwegian is the first foreign language. </p>
<p>Many immigrants have come to Norway in the last 30–40 years. They mostly live in and around Oslo, and in the other big cities. Many immigrants come from nearby countries, like Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Russia. There are also many from countries far away, such as <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/Somalia" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>, <a href="/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, all Norwegians were <a href="/Lutheranism" title="Lutheranism">Lutherans</a>, a variety of the <a href="/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> faith. Still, more than 80% of Norwegians are Lutherans. Other important faiths include <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, other Protestant groups and <a href="/Catholicism" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>.  </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tourism">Tourism</span></h3>
<p>Among tourists to Norway, more come from <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> than from any other country. There are also many Swedes, Danes, British, Dutch and Italians visiting Norway. The Swedes and Danes often come in winter to go skiing. The others mainly come in summer. Many people visit Norway to see the Northern Lights, also known as the 'Aurora Borealis'.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Media">Media</span></h2>
<p>The largest national newspapers in Norway are <a href="/Verdens_Gang" title="Verdens Gang">Verdens Gang</a> (VG), <a href="/Aftenposten" title="Aftenposten">Aftenposten</a> and <a href="/Dagbladet" title="Dagbladet">Dagbladet</a>. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Culture">Culture</span></h2>
<p>Norwegian culture can be compared to English culture in the way that it is considered a bad thing to show off, as opposed to the US, where this is more acceptable. This is a big aspect of Norwegian culture, and it is related to the philosophy of <a href="/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a>. Because of this, people will understate things, for example if a Norwegian says something is good or nice, it can mean that it's really great.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics">Politics</span></h2>
<p>In Norway power is shared among three branches: The justice sector, the government and the <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">parliament</a> (<a href="/Stortinget" title="Stortinget">Stortinget</a>). Norway also has a king, <a href="/Harald_V_of_Norway" title="Harald V of Norway">Harald V</a>, but he does not have any real power and acts as a symbol and <a href="/Ambassador" title="Ambassador">ambassador</a>. This form of government is called a <a href="/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. Elections are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or <a href="/Coalition" title="Coalition">coalition</a> of parties that gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, the winners work together to find out who the <a href="/Prime_minister" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a> should be, as well as who the other <a href="/Minister_(government)" title="Minister (government)">ministers</a> should be.</p>
<p>Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Norway, from left to right on the <a href="/Politics#Left-wing_and_right-wing_political_parties" title="Politics">political axis</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/Red_(Norway)" title="Red (Norway)">Red</a> (Rødt): A <a href="/Revolutionary_socialist" title="Revolutionary socialist">revolutionary socialist</a> party which works for equality of income, labour rights, a controlled economy and <a href="/Feminism" title="Feminism">feminism</a>. Red is the only party on this list that is not in the Norwegian parliament. </li>
<li><a href="/Socialist_Left_Party_(Norway)" title="Socialist Left Party (Norway)">Socialist Left Party</a> (Sosialistisk venstreparti): The party is not very radical and is concerned with environmental issues as well as education. The party is traditionally regarded as the "teacher's party" because of their focus on learning and school. One might call SV more of a <a href="/Social_democracy" title="Social democracy">social democratic</a> party than a socialist party, since their socialist views have faded over the years. They were more radical in the 1970s and 80s. </li>
<li><a href="/Norwegian_Labour_Party" title="Norwegian Labour Party">Norwegian Labour Party</a> (Arbeiderpartiet): The Labour Party is the biggest party in Norway. They work for a strong economy with many regulations on private businesses, and are traditionally the party for workers, securing labour rights and the <a href="/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a>. </li>
