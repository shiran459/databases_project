<b>Windows Internet Explorer</b> (August 16, 1995 – April 26, 2016), formerly known as <b>IE</b>, <b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b>, and <b>MSIE</b>, was a series of <a href="/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface">graphical</a> <a href="/Web_browser" title="Web browser">web browsers</a> developed by <a href="/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. It was included as part of the <a href="/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a>, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95, that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in <a href="/Service_pack" title="Service pack">service packs</a>, and included in releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.</p>
<p>IE has been the <a href="/Usage_share_of_web_browsers" title="Usage share of web browsers">most popular</a> web browser since 1999, attaining a peak of about 95% usage share during 2002/2003 with <a href="/Internet_Explorer_5" title="Internet Explorer 5">IE5</a> and <a href="/Internet_Explorer_6" title="Internet Explorer 6">IE6</a>. Since its peak of popularity, its usage share has declined in the face of renewed competition from other web browsers to 55%, and is slowly trending downward. Microsoft spent over <a href="/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>100 million per year on IE<sup class="reference" id="_ref-victor"><a href="#_note-victor" title="">[1]</a></sup> in the late 1990s, with over 1000 people working on it by 1999.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ericsink1"><a href="#_note-ericsink1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The latest release is <a href="/Internet_Explorer_11" title="Internet Explorer 11">Internet Explorer 11</a>. Internet Explorer was originally planned to be omitted from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 in Europe, but Microsoft later dropped the plans, and instead included a browser ballot screen with the products, allowing users to select a different web browser if they wish.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> <a href="/Windows_10" title="Windows 10">Windows 10</a> does not include Explorer but rather <a href="/Microsoft_Edge" title="Microsoft Edge">Microsoft Edge</a>. </p>
<p>Versions of Internet Explorer for other <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating systems</a> have also been produced, including an embedded OEM version called Internet Explorer for Windows CE (IE CE), available for WinCE based platforms and currently based on IE6; Internet Explorer for <a href="/Pocket_PC" title="Pocket PC">Pocket PC</a>, later rebranded <a href="/Internet_Explorer_Mobile" title="Internet Explorer Mobile">Internet Explorer Mobile</a>, which is made for <a href="/Windows_Mobile" title="Windows Mobile">Windows Mobile</a> and <a href="/Windows_CE" title="Windows CE">Windows CE</a> and remains in development alongside the more advanced desktop versions; and the discontinued <a href="/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac" title="Internet Explorer for Mac">Internet Explorer for Mac</a> and <a href="/Internet_Explorer_for_UNIX" title="Internet Explorer for UNIX">Internet Explorer for UNIX</a> (<a href="/Solaris_(operating_system)" title="Solaris (operating system)">Solaris</a> and <a href="/HP-UX" title="HP-UX">HP-UX</a>).</p>

<p>The Internet Explorer project was started in the summer of 1994 by Thomas Reardon,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> using source code from <a href="/Spyglass%2C_Inc." title="Spyglass, Inc.">Spyglass, Inc.</a> Mosaic, an early commercial web browser with formal ties to the pioneering <a href="/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications" title="National Center for Supercomputing Applications">NCSA</a> <a href="/Mosaic_(web_browser)" title="Mosaic (web browser)">Mosaic</a> browser. In late 1994, <a href="/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> licensed Spyglass Mosaic for a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's non-Windows revenues for the software.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Although bearing a name similar to NCSA Mosaic, the Spyglass Mosaic had used the NCSA Mosaic source code sparingly.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-SpyglassMosaic"><a href="#_note-SpyglassMosaic" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internet_Explorer_1">Internet Explorer 1</span></h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 1</b> made its debut on August 16, 1995. It was a reworked version of <a href="/Spyglass_Mosaic" title="Spyglass Mosaic">Spyglass Mosaic</a>, which Microsoft had licensed, like many other companies initiating browser development, from Spyglass Inc. It came with <a href="/Microsoft_Plus!" title="Microsoft Plus!">Microsoft Plus!</a> for <a href="/Windows_95" title="Windows 95">Windows 95</a> and the OEM release of Windows 95. It was installed as part of the <i>Internet Jumpstart Kit</i> in Plus!.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The Internet Explorer team began with about six people in early development.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-autogenerated1"><a href="#_note-autogenerated1" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-autogenerated2"><a href="#_note-autogenerated2" title="">[12]</a></sup> Internet Explorer 1.5 was released several months later for Windows NT and added support for basic table rendering. However, by including it for free on their OS, they did not have to pay royalties to Spyglass Inc., which resulted in a lawsuit and a multi-million USD settlement.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internet_Explorer_2">Internet Explorer 2</span></h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 2</b> was released for Windows 95, <a href="/Windows_NT_3.5" title="Windows NT 3.5">Windows NT 3.5</a>, and <a href="/Windows_NT_4.0" title="Windows NT 4.0">NT 4.0</a> on November 22, 1995 (following a 2.0 beta in October). It featured support for SSL, cookies, <a href="/VRML" title="VRML">VRML</a>, <a href="/RSA" title="RSA">RSA</a>, and <a href="/Usenet" title="Usenet">Internet newsgroups</a>. Version 2 was also the first release for <a href="/Windows_3.1" title="Windows 3.1">Windows 3.1</a> and Macintosh System 7.0.1 (PPC or 68k), although the Mac version was not released until January 1996 for PPC, and April for 68k.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Version 2.1 for the Mac came out in August 1996, although by this time, Windows was getting 3.0. Version 2 was included in Windows 95 OSR 1 and Microsoft's <i>Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95</i> in early 1996.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-14"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> It launched with twelve languages including English but this expanded to 24, 20, and 9 for Win 95, Win 3.1, and Mac respectively by April 1996.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-apr96ms"><a href="#_note-apr96ms" title="">[15]</a></sup> The 2.0i version supported double-byte character-set.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-apr96ms_b"><a href="#_note-apr96ms" title="">[15]</a></sup>
</p>


<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internet_Explorer_3">Internet Explorer 3</span></h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 3</b> was released on August 13, 1996, and went on to be much more popular than its predecessors.  Internet Explorer 3 was the first major browser with <a href="/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a> support, although this support was only partial. It also introduced support for <a href="/ActiveX" title="ActiveX">ActiveX</a> <a href="/ActiveX_control" title="ActiveX control">controls</a>, <a href="/Java_applet" title="Java applet">Java applets</a>, inline multimedia, and the <a href="/Platform_for_Internet_Content_Selection" title="Platform for Internet Content Selection">PICS</a> system for content <a href="/Metadata" title="Metadata">metadata</a>. Version 3 also came bundled with <a href="/Internet_Mail_and_News" title="Internet Mail and News">Internet Mail and News</a>, <a href="/Microsoft_NetMeeting" title="Microsoft NetMeeting">NetMeeting</a>, and an early version of the <a href="/Windows_Address_Book" title="Windows Address Book">Windows Address Book</a>, and was itself included with Windows 95 OSR 2. Version 3 proved to be the first more popular version of Internet Explorer, which brought with it increased scrutiny. In the months following its release, a number of security and privacy vulnerabilities were found by researchers and hackers. This version of Internet Explorer was the first to have the 'blue e' logo.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mshistory"><a href="#_note-mshistory" title="">[17]</a></sup> The Internet Explorer team consisted of roughly 100 people during the development of three months.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-victor_b"><a href="#_note-victor" title="">[1]</a></sup> The first major IE security hole, the Princeton Word Macro Virus Loophole, was discovered on August 22, 1996 in IE3.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-nwnetworks"><a href="#_note-nwnetworks" title="">[18]</a></sup> Backwards compatibility was handled by allowing users who upgraded to IE3 to still use the last IE, because the installation converted the previous version to a separate directory.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-19"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internet_Explorer_4">Internet Explorer 4</span></h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 4</b>, released in September 1997, deepened the level of integration between the web browser and the underlying operating system. Installing version 4 on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 machine and choosing <i><a href="/Windows_Desktop_Update" title="Windows Desktop Update">Windows Desktop Update</a></i> would result in the traditional Windows Explorer also being replaced by a version more akin to a web-browser interface, as well as the Windows desktop itself being web-enabled via <a href="/Active_Desktop" title="Active Desktop">Active Desktop</a>. The integration with Windows, however, was subject to numerous packaging criticisms (see <a href="/United_States_v._Microsoft" title="United States v. Microsoft">United States v. Microsoft</a>). This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer but was not removed from the system if already installed. Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for <a href="/Group_Policy" title="Group Policy">Group Policy</a>, allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browser's configuration as well as support for offline browsing.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-20"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Internet Mail and News was replaced with <a href="/Outlook_Express" title="Outlook Express">Outlook Express</a>, and <a href="/Microsoft_Chat" title="Microsoft Chat">Microsoft Chat</a> and an improved NetMeeting were also included. This version also was included with <a href="/Windows_98" title="Windows 98">Windows 98</a>. New features were added that allow you to save and retrieve posts in comment forms which are still not being used today. Internet Explorer 4.5 offered new features such as easier 128-bit encryption. It also offered a dramatic stability improvement over prior versions, particularly the <a href="/68k" title="68k">68k</a> version which was especially prone to freezing.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-21"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-22"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-23"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>



<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internet_Explorer_5">Internet Explorer 5</span></h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 5</b>, launched on March 18, 1999, and subsequently included with <a href="/Windows_98" title="Windows 98">Windows 98 Second Edition</a> and bundled with <a href="/Microsoft_Office" title="Microsoft Office">Office 2000</a>, was another significant release that supported <a href="/Bi-directional_text" title="Bi-directional text">bi-directional text</a>, <a href="/Ruby_character" title="Ruby character">ruby characters</a>, <a href="/XML" title="XML">XML</a>, <a href="/XSLT" title="XSLT">XSLT</a>, and the ability to save web pages in <a href="/MHTML" title="MHTML">MHTML</a> format. IE5 was bundled with <a href="/Outlook_Express" title="Outlook Express">Outlook Express 5</a>. Also, with the release of Internet Explorer 5.0, Microsoft released the first version of <a href="/XMLHttpRequest" title="XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>, giving birth to <a href="/Ajax_(programming)" title="Ajax (programming)">Ajax</a> (even though the term "Ajax" was not coined until years later). It was the last with a 16-bit version. Internet Explorer 5.01, a bug fix version, was released in December 1999. <a href="/Windows_2000" title="Windows 2000">Windows 2000</a> includes this version. Internet Explorer 5.5 followed in July 2000, improving its print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with <a href="/Windows_Me" title="Windows Me">Windows Me</a>.  However, version 5 was the last version for <a href="/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac" title="Internet Explorer for Mac">Mac</a> and <a href="/Internet_Explorer_for_UNIX" title="Internet Explorer for UNIX">UNIX</a>. Version 5.5 was the last to have <i>Compatibility Mode</i>, which allowed Internet Explorer 4<sup class="reference" id="_ref-25"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> to be run side by side with the 5.x.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mshistory_b"><a href="#_note-mshistory" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-26"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> The IE team consisted of over 1,000 people by 1999, with funding on the order of 100 million <a href="/USD" title="USD">USD</a> per year.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-victor_c"><a href="#_note-victor" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-ericsink1_b"><a href="#_note-ericsink1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>



<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internet_Explorer_6">Internet Explorer 6</span></h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 6</b> was released on August 27, 2001, a few months before <a href="/Windows_XP" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a>. This version included DHTML enhancements, content restricted inline frames, and partial support of CSS level 1, <a href="/Document_Object_Model" title="Document Object Model">DOM</a> level 1, and <a href="/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language" title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</a> 2.0.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Axistive"><a href="#_note-Axistive" title="">[28]</a></sup> The <a href="/MSXML" title="MSXML">MSXML</a> engine was also updated to version 3.0. Other new features included a new version of the <a href="/Internet_Explorer_Administration_Kit" title="Internet Explorer Administration Kit">Internet Explorer Administration Kit</a> (IEAK), Media bar, <a href="/Windows_Messenger" title="Windows Messenger">Windows Messenger</a> integration, fault collection, automatic image resizing, <a href="/P3P" title="P3P">P3P</a>, and a new look-and-feel that was in line with the <a href="/Luna_(theme)" title="Luna (theme)"><i>Luna</i></a> visual style of Windows XP, when used in Windows XP. Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 offered several security enhancements and coincided with the Windows XP SP1 patch release. In 2002, the <a href="/Gopher_(protocol)" title="Gopher (protocol)">Gopher protocol</a> was disabled and support for it was dropped in Internet Explorer 7.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-IE_Gopher"><a href="#_note-IE_Gopher" title="">[29]</a></sup> Internet Explorer 6.0 SV1<sup class="reference" id="_ref-sv1"><a href="#_note-sv1" title="">[30]</a></sup> came out August 6, 2004 for <a href="/Windows_XP_SP2" title="Windows XP SP2">Windows XP SP2</a> and offered various security enhancements and new color buttons on the user interface.  IE6 updated the original 'blue e' logo to a lighter blue and more <a href="/3D_computer_graphics" title="3D computer graphics">3D</a> look.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mshistory_c"><a href="#_note-mshistory" title="">[17]</a></sup> Microsoft now considers IE6 to be an obsolete product and recommends that users upgrade to IE8.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Internet_Explorer_7">Internet Explorer 7</span></h3>

<p><b>Internet Explorer 7</b> was released on October 18, 2006. It includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, <a href="/Tabbed_document_interface" title="Tabbed document interface">tabbed browsing</a> with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine search box, a web feeds reader, <a href="/Internationalized_Domain_Name" title="Internationalized Domain Name">Internationalized Domain Name</a> support (IDN), <a href="/Extended_Validation_Certificate" title="Extended Validation Certificate">Extended Validation Certificate</a> support, and anti-phishing filter. With IE7, Internet Explorer has been decoupled from the Windows Shell - unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer <a href="/ActiveX_control" title="ActiveX control">ActiveX control</a> is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather runs in a separate Internet Explorer process. It is included with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and is available for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and later. The original release of Internet Explorer 7 required the computer to pass a <a href="/Windows_Genuine_Advantage" title="Windows Genuine Advantage">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> validation check prior to installing, but on October 5, 2007, <a href="/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> removed this requirement.

<dl>
<dt>Non-standard extensions</dt>
</dl>

<p>Internet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards, including HTML, CSS, and the DOM.  This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards-compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a "<a href="/Quirks_mode" title="Quirks mode">quirks mode</a>" to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to JScript which have been adopted by other browsers. These include the innerHTML property, which returns the HTML string within an element; the XMLHttpRequest object, which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response; and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object, which enables rich text editing of HTML documents. Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods. Its <a href="/Ruby_character" title="Ruby character">Ruby character</a> extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.</p>
<p>Microsoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behavior' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviors (known as HTML Components, HTC); <a href="/HTMLplusTIME" title="HTMLplusTIME">HTML+TIME</a> profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C <a href="/XHTMLplusSMIL" title="XHTMLplusSMIL">XHTML+SMIL</a>); and the <a href="/VML" title="VML">VML</a> <a href="/Vector_graphics" title="Vector graphics">vector graphics</a> file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms. VML was, however, subsequently combined with <a href="/PGML" title="PGML">PGML</a> (proposed by <a href="/Adobe_Systems" title="Adobe Systems">Adobe</a> and <a href="/Sun_Microsystems" title="Sun Microsystems">Sun</a>), resulting in the W3C-approved <a href="/Scalable_Vector_Graphics" title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</a> format, currently one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, and which IE is now virtually unique in not supporting.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-61"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other non-standard behaviors include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation; Support for a variety of image effects<sup class="reference" id="_ref-62"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS; Support for <a href="/Obfuscated_code" title="Obfuscated code">obfuscated</a> script code, in particular <code>JScript.Encode()</code>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-63"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Support for <a href="/Font_embedding" title="Font embedding">embedding</a> <a href="/Embedded_OpenType" title="Embedded OpenType">EOT</a> fonts in <a href="/Font_embedding_on_the_Web" title="Font embedding on the Web">web pages</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-64"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="/Favicon" title="Favicon">favicon</a> (short for "favorites icon") introduced by Internet Explorer is now also supported and extended in other browsers.  It allows web pages to specify a 16-by-16 pixel image for use in bookmarks.  In IE, support was, and still is, provided only for the native Windows ICO format; in other browsers it has now been extended to other types of images such as PNG and GIF.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Usability and accessibility</dt>

<p>Internet Explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows. Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations similar to that of Windows Explorer. <a href="/Pop-up_blocking" title="Pop-up blocking">Pop-up blocking</a> and <a href="/Tabbed_browsing" title="Tabbed browsing">tabbed browsing</a> were added respectively in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7.

<dl>
<dt>Cache</dt>
</dl>
<p>{{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}</p>
<p>Internet Explorer caches visited content in the <a href="/Temporary_Internet_Files" title="Temporary Internet Files">Temporary Internet Files</a> folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages. The content is indexed in a database file, known as <a href="/Index.dat" title="Index.dat">Index.dat</a>. Multiple <a href="/Index.dat" title="Index.dat">Index.dat</a> files exist which index different content - visited content, <a href="/Web_feed" title="Web feed">web feeds</a>, visited <a href="/URL" title="URL">URLs</a>, cookies, etc.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-65"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk. In IE7 and later, when the cache is cleared, the cache files are more reliably removed, and the index.dat file is overwritten with null bytes.</p>

MSHTML.dll parses the HTML/CSS file and creates the internal <a href="/Document_Object_Model" title="Document Object Model">DOM</a> tree representation of it. It also exposes a set of <a href="/API" title="API">APIs</a> for runtime inspection and modification of the DOM tree.  The DOM tree is further processed by a layout engine which then renders the internal representation on screen.</li>
<li><i>IEFrame.dll</i> contains the user interface and window of IE in Internet Explorer 7 and above.</li>

</ul>
<p><sup class="reference" id="_ref-67"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>Internet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality. Rather, MSHTML.dll exposes an API that permit a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the <a href="/Active_Scripting" title="Active Scripting">Active Scripting</a> engine, which is a part of <a href="/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the <a href="/JScript" title="JScript">JScript</a> and <a href="/VBScript" title="VBScript">VBScript</a> modules are provided; third party implementations like <a href="/ScreamingMonkey" title="ScreamingMonkey">ScreamingMonkey</a> (for <a href="/ECMAScript" title="ECMAScript">ECMAScript 4</a> support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the <a href="/Microsoft_Silverlight" title="Microsoft Silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a> runtime that allows <a href="/CLI_languages" title="CLI languages">CLI languages</a>, including <a href="/Dynamic_Language_Runtime" title="Dynamic Language Runtime">DLR</a>-based dynamic languages like <a href="/IronPython" title="IronPython">IronPython</a> and <a href="/IronRuby" title="IronRuby">IronRuby</a>, to be used for client-side scripting.</p>
<p><a href="/Internet_Explorer_8" title="Internet Explorer 8">Internet Explorer 8</a> introduces some major architectural changes, called <i>Loosely Coupled IE</i> (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different <a href="/Mandatory_Integrity_Control" title="Mandatory Integrity Control">integrity level</a>; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous <a href="/Inter-Process_Communication" title="Inter-Process Communication">Inter-Process Communication</a> to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In <a href="/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a> with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-68"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Extensibility">Extensibility</span></h2>
<p>Internet Explorer exposes a set of <a href="/Component_Object_Model" title="Component Object Model">Component Object Model</a> (COM) interfaces that allow other components to extend the functionality of the browser.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-architecture_b"><a href="#_note-architecture" title="">[66]</a></sup> Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and Content extensibility. The browser extensibility interfaces can be used to plug in components to add context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or <a href="/Browser_Helper_Objects" title="Browser Helper Objects">Browser Helper Objects</a> (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose the feature in the UI. Content extensibility interfaces are used by different content-type handlers to add support for non-native content formats.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-architecture_c"><a href="#_note-architecture" title="">[66]</a></sup> BHOs not only have unrestricted access to the Internet Explorer <a href="/Document_Object_Model" title="Document Object Model">DOM</a> and event model, they also can access the filesystem, registry and other OS components. Content extensibility can be either in terms of <i>Active Documents</i> (<i>Doc Objects</i>) (e.g., <a href="/Scalable_Vector_Graphics" title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</a> or <a href="/MathML" title="MathML">MathML</a>) or <i><a href="/ActiveX" title="ActiveX">ActiveX</a> controls</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-architecture_d"><a href="#_note-architecture" title="">[66]</a></sup> ActiveX controls are used for content handlers that render content embedded within an HTML page (e.g., <a href="/Adobe_Flash" title="Adobe Flash">Adobe Flash</a> or <a href="/Microsoft_Silverlight" title="Microsoft Silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a>). Doc objects are used when the content type will not be embedded in HTML (e.g., <a href="/Microsoft_Word" title="Microsoft Word">Microsoft Word</a>, <a href="/Portable_Document_Format" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a> or <a href="/XML_Paper_Specification" title="XML Paper Specification">XPS</a>). In fact, the Trident rendering engine is itself exposed as a Doc object, so HTML in itself is treated as an Active Document.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-architecture_e"><a href="#_note-architecture" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>Internet Explorer add-on components run with the same privileges as the browser itself, unlike client-side scripts that have a very limited set of privileges. Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site. Since the add-ons have a more privileged access to the system, malicious add-ons can and have been used to compromise the security of the system. Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 2 onwards provide various safeguards against this, including an <a href="/Plug-in_(computing)" title="Plug-in (computing)">Add-on</a> Manager for controlling ActiveX controls and Browser Helper Objects and a "No Add-Ons" mode of operation as well as greater restrictions on sites installing add-ons.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside the application. Also, the hosting application can choose to host only the MSHTML.dll rendering engine, rather than the entire browser.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-architecture_f"><a href="#_note-architecture" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>{{Other pages|Component Object Model|Browser Helper Object}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Security">Security</span></h2>
<p>Internet Explorer uses a zone-based <a href="/Computer_security" title="Computer security">security</a> framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the <i>Attachment Execution Service</i> of <a href="/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to <a href="/Phishing" title="Phishing">phishing</a> sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host <a href="/Malware" title="Malware">malware</a>. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a>, Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called <i>Protected Mode</i>, where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted - it cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.</p>
<p>Patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through <a href="/Automatic_Updates" title="Automatic Updates">Automatic Updates</a>. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.</p>
<p>On December 16, 2008, <a href="/Trend_Micro" title="Trend Micro">Trend Micro</a> recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency IE patch was released to fix a potential security risk which "could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords". Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that "0.02% of internet sites" were affected by the flaw.</p>
<p>On December 17, 2008, a fix to the security problem above became available, with the release of the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, which is available from Microsoft Windows Update's webpage. Microsoft has said that this update fixes the security risk found by Trend Micro the previous day.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-69"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-70"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>

<p>A number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but <a href="/ActiveX" title="ActiveX">ActiveX</a>-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-71"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> In 2006, new techniques using automated testing found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-72"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> Security features introduced in then recently released Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer in 2008 had a number of published security vulnerabilities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Market_adoption_and_usage_share">Market adoption and usage share</span></h2>
<p>{{Other pages|Usage share of web browsers}}
The adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996 to about 40% in 1998 and over 80% in 2000.</p>
<p>A CNN article noted at the release of Internet Explorer 4: "Microsoft's Internet Explorer has made inroads and various estimates put its share of the browser market 30 to 35 percent from about 10 percent a year ago."<sup class="reference" id="_ref-80"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> By 2002, Internet Explorer had almost completely superseded its main rival <a href="/Netscape" title="Netscape">Netscape</a> and dominated the market with up to 95 percent market share.</p>
<p>After having fought and won the <a href="/Browser_wars" title="Browser wars">browser wars</a> of the late 1990s, Internet Explorer gained almost total dominance of the browser market. Having attained a peak of about 95% during 2002 and 2003, its market share has since declined at a slow but steady pace. This is mainly due to the adoption of <a href="/Mozilla_Firefox" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>, which statistics indicate is currently the most significant competition. Nevertheless, Internet Explorer remains the dominant web browser, with a global usage share of around 60% (though measurements vary). Usage is higher in Asia and lower in Europe.</p>
<p>Firefox 1.0 had surpassed <a href="/Internet_Explorer_5" title="Internet Explorer 5">Internet Explorer 5</a> in early 2005 with Firefox 1.0 at roughly 8 percent market share.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-81"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup>
An article notes at the release of <a href="/Internet_Explorer_7" title="Internet Explorer 7">Internet Explorer 7</a> in October 2006 that "IE6 had the lion's share of the browser market with 77.22%. Internet Explorer 7 had climbed to 3.18%, while Firefox 2.0 was at 0.69%."<sup class="reference" id="_ref-82"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="OS_compatibility">OS compatibility</span></h2>
<p>IE versions, over time, have had widely varying OS compatibility, ranging from being available for many platforms and several versions of Windows to only a few versions of Windows. Many versions of IE had some support for an older OS but stopped getting updates. The increased growth of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s means that current browsers with small market shares have more total users than the entire market early on. For example, 90% market share in 1997 would be roughly 60 million<sup class="reference" id="_ref-internetworldstats1"><a href="#_note-internetworldstats1" title="">[95]</a></sup> users, but by the start of 2007 90% market share would equate to over 900 million users.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-internetworldstats1_b"><a href="#_note-internetworldstats1" title="">[95]</a></sup> The result is that later versions of IE6 had many more users in total than all the early versions put together.</p>
<p>The release of IE7 at the end of 2006 resulted in a collapse of IE6 market share; by February 2007, market version share statistics showed IE6 at about 50% and IE7 at 29%.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-96"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup> Regardless of the actual market share, the most compatible version (across operating systems) of IE was 5.x, which had Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, Unix, and most Windows versions available and supported for a short period in the late 1990s (although 4.x had a more unified codebase across versions). By 2007, IE had much narrower OS support, with the latest versions supporting only Windows XP Service Pack 2 and above.  Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0 (Experimental) have also been unofficially ported to the <a href="/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a> operating system from the project <a href="/IEs4Linux" title="IEs4Linux">IEs4Linux</a>.

<p>Early versions of Internet Explorer such as 5 had a compatibility mode to run Internet Explorer 4, though this feature was dropped (also, Internet Explorer for Mac users could still use 4.5 after installing IE 5). While Microsoft claims it is impossible to keep multiple versions of Internet Explorer on the same machine, some <a href="/Hacker_(computing)" title="Hacker (computing)">hackers</a> have successfully separated several versions of Internet Explorer, making them standalone applications. These are referred to as "standalone" IEs and have included versions 3 through 7.

<p>Microsoft has discontinued standalone installers for Internet Explorer to the general public. However, there are unofficial procedures for downloading the complete install package. Internet Explorer standalone uses a feature introduced in Windows 2000 called <a class="external text" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682600.aspx" rel="nofollow">DLL redirection</a> to force it to load older DLLs than the ones installed on the system.

<ul>
<li><a href="/IEs4Linux" title="IEs4Linux">IEs4Linux</a> automatically sets up Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 in Wine. Supporting Internet Explorer 7 is currently in development; as of August 2007, the IE7 rendering engine can be used with the IE6 user interface.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-101"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>After Internet Explorer 7 is installed, an Internet Explorer 6 executable is still available in C:\WINDOWS\ie7, hidden by default. Launching this executable provides the user with the older IE6 interface, however web pages are rendered using the IE7 engine. The IE6 engine can be re-enabled by placing a file named "iexplore.exe.local" into the IE7 folder.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Removal_and_death">Removal and death</span></h2>
<p>While a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.</p>
<p>The idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the United States v. Microsoft court case. One of Microsoft's arguments, during the trial, was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability.</p>
<p>Removing Internet Explorer does have a number of consequences. Applications that depend on libraries installed by IE will fail to function, or have unexpected behaviors. The Windows help and support system will also not function due to the heavy reliance on <a href="/HTML_help" title="HTML help">HTML help</a> files and components of IE. In versions of Windows before <a href="/Windows_Vista" title="Windows Vista">Vista</a>, it is also not possible to run Microsoft's <a href="/Windows_Update" title="Windows Update">Windows Update</a> or <a href="/Microsoft_Update" title="Microsoft Update">Microsoft Update</a> with any other browser due to the service's implementation of an <a href="/ActiveX" title="ActiveX">ActiveX</a> control, which no other browser supports. In Windows Vista, <a href="/Windows_Update" title="Windows Update">Windows Update</a> is implemented as a <a href="/Control_Panel_(Windows)" title="Control Panel (Windows)">Control Panel</a> applet.</p>
<p>With Windows 7, Microsoft added the ability to safely remove Internet Explorer 8 from Windows.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Internet_Explorer_8_can_be_removed_from_Windows_7"><a href="#_note-Internet_Explorer_8_can_be_removed_from_Windows_7" title="">[105]</a></sup> Microsoft does not allow the dependencies to be removed through this process, but the Internet Explorer executable (iexplore.exe) is removed without harming any other Windows components.</p>
<p>On April 26, 2016, both IE and <a href="/Mozilla_Firefox" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> were diagnosed with cancer and went into surgery. Their friend <a href="/Text_to_Speech" title="Text to Speech">Microsoft Sam</a> was scheduled to go see them at the hospital, but when a doctor told him that they were not gonna make it through the surgery, he became filled with sadness.
