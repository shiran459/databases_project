<p>Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, India.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Several members of his family worked for the government of the state.  When Gandhi was 18 years old, he went to <a href="/England" title="England">England</a> to study law.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  After he became a <a href="/Lawyer" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a>, he went to the British colony of <a href="/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> where he experienced laws that said people with  dark  <a href="/Human_skin_colour" title="Human skin colour">skin</a> had fewer rights than people with light skin. In 1897, Gandhi was attacked by a group of people in Durban Harbor, South Africa when he was going to work. He went to South Africa because he could not find work in India.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> When traveling through South Africa, Gandhi was also kicked out of a first class train because of his skin color. Then Gandhi started protesting against segregation.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws.  He created a powerful, non-violent movement.  During Gandhi's life, India was a <a href="/Colony" title="Colony">colony</a> of the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, but wanted <a href="/Independence" title="Independence">independence</a>.  He was a huge leader during that era and his thoughts helped catalyse the Indian independence movement.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1915, when Gandhi returned to India, he decided to again lead a march against a law called the Rowlatt Act. But then the protest turned violent and people started to kill the protesters.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1930, Gandhi led the <a href="/Salt_March" title="Salt March">Salt March</a>.</p>
<p>When he returned to India, he helped cause India's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial people to work for their own independence, break up the <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, and replace it with the <a href="/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a>.</p>
<p>People of many different <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religions</a> and <a href="/Ethnic_group" title="Ethnic group">ethnic groups</a> lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that <a href="/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hindus</a> and <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Muslims</a> should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country.</p>
<p>In 1938, Gandhi resigned from Congress.  He said that he was no longer able to work through Congress to unite the divisions in caste and religion.  He also felt that he had little to offer to the political process.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1947, <a href="/British_Raj" title="British Raj">British Indian Empire</a> became independent, breaking India in two, India and <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. Gandhi wanted independence, but did not want to split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was crying over the division of India.</p>
<p>Gandhi's principle of <i>satyagraha</i>, often translated as "way of truth" or "pursuit of truth", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like <a href="/Martin_Luther_King%2C_Jr." title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> and <a href="/Nelson_Mandela" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (<i>satya</i>), and non-violence (<i>ahimsa</i>).</p>
