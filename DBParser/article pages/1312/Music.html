<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_music.3F">What is music?</span></h2>
<p>Music is sound that has been organized by using <a href="/Rhythm" title="Rhythm">rhythm</a>, <a href="/Melody" title="Melody">melody</a> or <a href="/Harmony" title="Harmony">harmony</a>. If someone bangs saucepans while <a href="/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a>, it makes noise. If a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way, they are making a simple type of music.</p>
<p>There are four things which music has most of the time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Music often has <i><a href="/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch (music)">pitch</a></i>. This means high and low <a href="/Note_(music)" title="Note (music)">notes</a>. <a href="/Tune" title="Tune">Tunes</a> are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch.</li>
<li>Music often has <i><a href="/Rhythm" title="Rhythm">rhythm</a></i>. Rhythm is the way the musical sounds and silences are put together in a sequence. Every tune has a rhythm that can be tapped. Music usually has a regular beat.</li>
<li>Music often has <i><a href="/Dynamics_(music)" title="Dynamics (music)">dynamics</a></i>. This means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between.</li>
<li>Music often has <i><a href="/Timbre" title="Timbre">timbre</a></i>. This is a French word (pronounced the French way: "TAM-br"). The "timbre" of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting. The sort of sound might be harsh, gentle, dry, warm, or something else. Timbre is what makes a <a href="/Clarinet" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a> sound different from an <a href="/Oboe" title="Oboe">oboe</a>, and what makes one person's <a href="/Voice" title="Voice">voice</a> sound different from another person.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Definitions">Definitions</span></h3>
<p>There is no simple definition of music which covers all cases. It is an art form, and <a href="/Opinion" title="Opinion">opinions</a> come into play. Music is whatever people think is music. A different approach is to list the qualities music must have, such as, sound which has rhythm, melody, pitch, timbre, etc.</p>
<p>These and other attempts, do not capture all aspects of music, or leave out examples which definitely are music. According to Thomas Clifton, music is "a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his <a href="/Behavior" title="Behavior">behavior</a>, and a sounding object".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Clifton"><a href="#_note-Clifton" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup>p10</sup> Musical experience and the music, together, are called <a href="/Phenomenon" title="Phenomenon">phenomena</a>, and the activity of describing phenomena is called <a href="/Phenomenology" title="Phenomenology">phenomenology</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>


<p>Even in the <a href="/Stone_age" title="Stone age">stone age</a> people made music. The first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds and rhythms that occurred naturally. Human music may echo these <a href="/Phenomenon" title="Phenomenon">phenomena</a> using <a href="/Pattern" title="Pattern">patterns</a>, <a href="/Repetition" title="Repetition">repetition</a> and <a href="/Tonality" title="Tonality">tonality</a>. This kind of music is still here today. <a href="/Shamanism" title="Shamanism">Shamans</a> sometimes imitate sounds that are heard in <a href="/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-onom"><a href="#_note-onom" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-soy"><a href="#_note-soy" title="">[3]</a></sup> It may also serve as <a href="/Entertainment" title="Entertainment">entertainment</a> (games),<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Nattiez"><a href="#_note-Nattiez" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-desch"><a href="#_note-desch" title="">[5]</a></sup> or have practical uses, like <a href="/Attraction" title="Attraction">attracting</a> animals when <a href="/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Nattiez_b"><a href="#_note-Nattiez" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some animals also can use music. <a href="/Songbird" title="Songbird">Songbirds</a> use <a href="/Song" title="Song">song</a> to <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simple:protect">protect</a> their <a href="/Territory" title="Territory">territory</a>, or to attract a <a href="/Mate" title="Mate">mate</a>. <a href="/Monkey" title="Monkey">Monkeys</a> have been seen beating hollow logs. This may, of course, also serve to defend the territory.</p>
<p>The first musical instrument used by humans was probably the <a href="/Voice" title="Voice">voice</a>. The human voice can make many different kinds of sounds. The <a href="/Larynx" title="Larynx">larynx</a> (voice box) is like a <a href="/Wind_instruments" title="Wind instruments">wind instrument</a>.</p>
<p>The oldest known <a href="/Neanderthal" title="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> <a href="/Hyoid" title="Hyoid">hyoid</a> bone with the modern human form was found in 1983,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> indicating that the Neanderthals had language, because the hyoid supports the voice box in the human throat.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most likely the first <a href="/Rhythm" title="Rhythm">rhythm</a> instruments or <a href="/Percussion_instruments" title="Percussion instruments">percussion instruments</a> involved the <a href="/Clapping" title="Clapping">clapping</a> of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to keep a beat. There are finds of this type that date back to the <a href="/Paleolithic" title="Paleolithic">paleolithic</a>. Some of these are ambiguous, as they can be used either as a <a href="/Tool" title="Tool">tool</a> or a musical instrument.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_first_flutes">The first flutes</span></h3>


<p>
The oldest <a href="/Flute" title="Flute">flute</a> ever discovered may be the so-called  <a href="/Divje_Babe_flute" title="Divje Babe flute">Divje Babe flute</a>, found in the <a href="/Slovenia" title="Slovenia">Slovenian</a> cave Divje Babe I in 1995. It is not certain that the object is really a flute.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Derrico"><a href="#_note-Derrico" title="">[9]</a></sup> The item in question is a fragment of the <a href="/Femur" title="Femur">femur</a> of a young cave <a href="/Bear" title="Bear">bear</a>, and has been dated to about 43,000 years ago.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> However, whether it is truly a musical instrument or simply a carnivore-chewed bone is a matter of ongoing debate.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Derrico_b"><a href="#_note-Derrico" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2008, <a href="/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archaeologists</a> discovered a bone flute in the <a href="/Hohle_Fels" title="Hohle Fels">Hohle Fels</a> cave near <a href="/Ulm" title="Ulm">Ulm</a>, <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>
<sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a <a href="/Vulture" title="Vulture">vulture</a> wing bone. The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal <i>Nature</i>, in June 2009. The discovery is also the oldest confirmed find of any musical instrument in history.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-BBC"><a href="#_note-BBC" title="">[14]</a></sup> Other flutes were also found in the cave. This  flute was found next to the <a href="/Venus_of_Hohle_Fels" title="Venus of Hohle Fels">Venus of Hohle Fels</a> and a short distance from the oldest known human carving.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-15"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> 
When they announced their discovery, the scientists suggested that the "finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-16"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near <a href="/Greystones" title="Greystones">Greystones</a>, <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>, in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50 cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-17"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1986 several bone flutes were found in <a href="/Jiahu" title="Jiahu">Jiahu</a> in Henan Province, China. They date to about 6,000 BC. They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the <a href="/Red-crowned_Crane" title="Red-crowned Crane">Red-crowned Crane</a>. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of <a href="/Xia_Zhi" title="Xia Zhi">Xia Zhi</a> and six-note scale of <a href="/Qing_Shang" title="Qing Shang">Qing Shang</a> of the ancient <a href="/Chinese_musical_system" title="Chinese musical system">Chinese musical system</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_times">Ancient times</span></h3>
<p>It is not known what the earliest music of the <a href="/Cave" title="Cave">cave</a> people was like. Some <a href="/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, even some <a href="/Painting" title="Painting">paintings</a>, are thousands of years old, but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down. The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments, or by finding them in <a href="/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a> digs (digging underground to find old things). The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in <a href="/Hurrians" title="Hurrians">Hurrian</a>, a <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a> spoken in and around northern <a href="/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (where Iraq is today), from about 1500 BC.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</span></h3>
<p>Another early piece of written music that has survived was a <a href="/Round_(music)" title="Round (music)">round</a> called <i><a href="/Sumer_Is_Icumen_In" title="Sumer Is Icumen In">Sumer Is Icumen In</a></i>. It was written down by a <a href="/Monk" title="Monk">monk</a> around the year 1250. Much of the music in the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> (roughly 450-1420) was <a href="/Folk_music" title="Folk music">folk music</a> played by working people who wanted to sing or dance. When people played instruments, they were usually playing for dancers. However, most of the music that was written down was for the <a href="/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Catholic church</a>. This music was written for monks to sing in church. It is called Chant (or <a href="/Gregorian_chant" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Renaissance">Renaissance</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> (roughly 1400-1550) there was a lot of music, and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed, played or sung today. The name for this period (Renaissance) is a French word which means "rebirth". This period was called the "rebirth" because many new types of <a href="/Art" title="Art">art</a> and music were <a href="/Birth" title="Birth">reborn</a> during this time.</p>
<p>Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services (sacred music) by the Italian composer <a href="/Giovanni_da_Palestrina" title="Giovanni da Palestrina">Giovanni da Palestrina</a> (1525-1594). In Palestrina's music, many singers sing together (this is called a <a href="/Choir_(music)" title="Choir (music)">choir</a>). There was also plenty of music not written for the church, such as happy <a href="/Dance_music" title="Dance music">dance music</a> and romantic love songs. Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the <a href="/Viol" title="Viol">viols</a> (a <a href="/String_instrument" title="String instrument">string instrument</a> played with a <a href="/Bow_(music)" title="Bow (music)">bow)</a>, <a href="/Lute" title="Lute">lutes</a> (a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a <a href="/Guitar" title="Guitar">guitar</a>), and the <a href="/Virginal" title="Virginal">virginal</a>, a small, quiet <a href="/Keyboard_instrument" title="Keyboard instrument">keyboard instrument</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Baroque">Baroque</span></h3>
<p>In the arts, the Baroque was a Western cultural era, which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome. It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, dance, and music.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-18"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> In music, the term 'Baroque' applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint, where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches, sometimes inverting the echo, and even reversing thematic material.</p>
<p>The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. In similar profusions of detail, art, music, architecture, and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns. Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details, often bright polychromy, less realistic faces of subjects, and an overall sense of awe, which was one of the goals in Baroque art.</p>
<p>The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun "barroco"<sup class="reference" id="_ref-19"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape. Hence, in informal usage, the word baroque can simply mean that something is "elaborate", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Classical_period">Classical period</span></h3>
<p>In western music, the <a href="/Classical_music_period" title="Classical music period">classical period</a> means music from about 1750 to 1825. It was the time of composers like <a href="/Joseph_Haydn" title="Joseph Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a>, <a href="/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>, and <a href="/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>. Orchestras became bigger, and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called <a href="/Symphony" title="Symphony">symphonies</a> that had several sections (called <a href="/Movement_(music)" title="Movement (music)">movements</a>). Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast; other movements were quiet and sad. The form of a piece of music was very important at this time. Music had to have a nice 'shape'. They often used a structure which was called <a href="/Sonata_form" title="Sonata form">sonata form</a>.</p>
<p>Another important type of music was the <a href="/String_quartet" title="String quartet">string quartet</a>, which is a piece of music written for two <a href="/Violin" title="Violin">violins</a>, a <a href="/Viola" title="Viola">viola</a>, and a <a href="/Violoncello" title="Violoncello">violoncello</a>. Like symphonies, string quartet music had several sections. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets.</p>
<p>The piano was invented during this time. Composers liked the piano, because it could be used to play dynamics (getting louder or getting softer). Other popular instruments included the <a href="/Violin" title="Violin">violin</a>, the <a href="/Violoncello" title="Violoncello">violoncello</a>, the <a href="/Flute" title="Flute">flute</a>, the <a href="/Clarinet" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a>, and the <a href="/Oboe" title="Oboe">oboe</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Romantic_period">Romantic period</span></h3>
<p>The 19th century is called the <a href="/Romantic_music" title="Romantic music">Romantic period</a>. Composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music. An important instrument from the Romantic period was the <a href="/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a>. Some composers, such as <a href="/Frederic_Chopin" title="Frederic Chopin">Frederic Chopin</a> wrote subdued, expressive, quietly emotional piano pieces. Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds. Other composers, such as <a href="/Franz_Schubert" title="Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert</a> wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called <a href="/Lied" title="Lied">Lied</a> (the German word for "song"). These Lieder (plural of Lied) told stories by using the <a href="/Lyrics" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a> (words) of the song and by the imaginative piano <a href="/Accompaniment_(music)" title="Accompaniment (music)">accompaniments</a>. Other composers, like Richard Strauss, and <a href="/Franz_Liszt" title="Franz Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> created narratives and told stories using only music, which is called a tone poem. Composers, such as <a href="/Franz_Liszt" title="Franz Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> and <a href="/Johannes_Brahms" title="Johannes Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a> used the piano to play loud, dramatic, strongly emotional music.</p>
<p>Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras, with as many as 100 instruments. It was the period of "<a href="/Nationalism" title="Nationalism">Nationalism</a>" (the feeling of being proud of one's country) when many composers made music using <a href="/Folk_music" title="Folk music">folksong</a> or melodies from their country. Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as <a href="/Franz_Schubert" title="Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>, <a href="/Felix_Mendelssohn" title="Felix Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a>, <a href="/Frederic_Chopin" title="Frederic Chopin">Frederic Chopin</a>, <a href="/Johannes_Brahms" title="Johannes Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a>, <a href="/Pyotr_Tchaikovsky" title="Pyotr Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Tchaikovsky</a> and <a href="/Richard_Wagner" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_times">Modern times</span></h3>
<p>From about 1900 onwards is called the "modern period". Many <a href="/20th_century" title="20th century">20th century</a> composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music. Modern composers searched for new ideas, such as using new instruments, different forms, different sounds, or different <a href="/Harmony" title="Harmony">harmonies</a>.</p>
<p>The composer <a href="/Arnold_Schoenberg" title="Arnold Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> (1874-1951) wrote pieces which were <a href="/Atonal" title="Atonal">atonal</a> (meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key). Later, Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called <a href="/Twelve-tone_system" title="Twelve-tone system">twelve-tone system</a>. Music written with the twelve-tone system sounds strange to some, but is mathematical in nature, often making sense only after careful study. Pure twelve-tone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties, but some composers such as <a href="/Benjamin_Britten" title="Benjamin Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> use it today, when it is necessary to get a certain feel.</p>
<p>One of the most important 20th-century composers, <a href="/Igor_Stravinsky" title="Igor Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a> (1882-1971), wrote music with very complicated (difficult) <a href="/Chord" title="Chord">chords</a> (groups of notes that are played together) and <a href="/Rhythm" title="Rhythm">rhythms</a>. Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote <a href="/Minimalism" title="Minimalism">Minimalist</a> pieces which use very simple ideas. In the 1950s and 1960s, composers such as <a href="/Karlheinz_Stockhausen" title="Karlheinz Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> experimented with <a href="/Electronic_music" title="Electronic music">electronic music</a>, using electronic circuits, <a href="/Amplifier" title="Amplifier">amplifiers</a> and <a href="/Loudspeaker" title="Loudspeaker">loudspeakers</a>. In the 1970s, composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from <a href="/Rock_and_roll" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a> music, such as the <a href="/Electric_guitar" title="Electric guitar">electric guitar</a>. They used these new instruments to make new sounds.</p>
<p>Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s, such as <a href="/John_Adams_(composer)" title="John Adams (composer)">John Adams</a> (born 1947) and <a href="/James_MacMillan" title="James MacMillan">James MacMillan</a> (born 1959) often use a mixture of all these ideas, but they like to write <a href="/Tonality" title="Tonality">tonal</a> music with easy tunes as well.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Electronic_music">Electronic music</span></h4>
<p>Music can be produced electronically. This is most commonly done by computers, keyboards, electric guitars and disk tables. They can mimic traditional instruments, and also produce very different sounds. 21st-century electronic music is commonly made with computer programs and hardware mixers.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Jazz">Jazz</span></h4>
<p><a href="/Jazz" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> is a type of music that was invented around 1900 in <a href="/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a> in the south of the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">USA</a>. There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called <a href="/Blues" title="Blues">blues</a> music. Blues music was influenced by <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">African</a> music (because the black people in the United States had come to the United States as <a href="/Slave" title="Slave">slaves</a>. They were taken from Africa by force). Blues music was a music that was played by singing, using the harmonica, or the acoustic guitar. Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions (feelings) or sad experiences, such as losing a job, a family member dying, or having to go to <a href="/Jail" title="Jail">jail</a> (prison).</p>
<p>Jazz music mixed together blues music with <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> music. Some black composers such as <a href="/Scott_Joplin" title="Scott Joplin">Scott Joplin</a> were writing music called <a href="/Ragtime" title="Ragtime">ragtime</a>, which had a very different rhythm from standard European music, but used notes that were similar to some European music. Ragtime was a big influence on early jazz, called Dixieland jazz. Jazz musicians used instruments such as the <a href="/Trumpet" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a>, <a href="/Saxophone" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a>, and <a href="/Clarinet" title="Clarinet">clarinet</a> were used for the tunes (melodies), drums for <a href="/Percussion" title="Percussion">percussion</a> and plucked <a href="/Double_bass" title="Double bass">double bass</a>, <a href="/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a>, <a href="/Banjo" title="Banjo">banjo</a> and <a href="/Guitar" title="Guitar">guitar</a> for the background rhythm (rhythmic section). Jazz is usually <a href="/Improvisation" title="Improvisation">improvised</a>: the players make up (invent) the music as they play. Even though jazz musicians are making up the music, jazz music still has <a href="/Rule" title="Rule">rules</a>; the musicians play a series of chords (groups of notes) in order.</p>
<p>Jazz music has a swinging rhythm. The word "swing" is hard to explain. For a rhythm to be a "swinging rhythm" it has to feel natural and relaxed. Swing rhythm is not even like a march. There is a long-short feel instead of a same-same feel. A "swinging rhythm" also gets the people who are listening excited, because they like the sound of it. Some people say that a "swinging rhythm" happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song. If a jazz band plays very well together, people will say "that is a swinging jazz band" or "that band really swings well."</p>
<p>Jazz influenced other types of music like the <a href="/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Western art music</a> from the 1920s and 1930s. Art music composers such as <a href="/George_Gershwin" title="George Gershwin">George Gershwin</a> wrote music that was influenced by jazz. Jazz music influenced <a href="/Pop_music" title="Pop music">pop music</a> songs. In the 1930s and 1940s, many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs. One of the best known jazz musicians was <a href="/Louis_Armstrong" title="Louis Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> (1900-1971).</p>

"Pop" music is a type of <i>popular</i> music that many people like to listen to. The term "pop music" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word "pop music" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular.</p>
<p>Modern pop music grew out of 1950s <a href="/Rock_and_roll" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a>, (for example <a href="/Chuck_Berry" title="Chuck Berry">Chuck Berry</a>, <a href="/Bo_Diddley" title="Bo Diddley">Bo Diddley</a> and <a href="/Little_Richard" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a>)<sup class="reference" id="_ref-20"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> and <a href="/Rockabilly" title="Rockabilly">rockabilly</a> (for example <a href="/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="/Buddy_Holly" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a>).{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 7, 12}}   In the 1960s, <a href="/The_Beatles" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> became a famous pop music group.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 27-28, 35, 39}} In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as <a href="/Funk" title="Funk">funk</a> and <a href="/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul music</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Musical_notation">Musical notation</span></h2>
<p>{{Main|Musical notation}}
</p>


<p>"Musical notation" is the way music is written down. Music needs to be written down in order to be saved and remembered for future performances. In this way composers (people who write music) can tell others how to play the musical piece as it was meant to be played.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Solf.C3.A8ge">Solfège</span></h3>
<p>Solfège (also called solfa) is the way tones are named. It was made in order to give a name to the several tones and pitches. For example, the eight basic notes "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do" are just the names of the eight notes that confirm the <a href="/Major_scale" title="Major scale">major scale</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Written_music">Written music</span></h3>
<p>Music can be written in several ways. When it is written on a <a href="/Staff_(music)" title="Staff (music)">staff</a> (like in the example shown), the pitches (tones) and their duration are represented by symbols called <a href="/Note_(music)" title="Note (music)">notes</a>. Notes are put on the lines and in the spaces between the lines. Each position says which tone must be played. The higher the note is on the staff, the higher the pitch of the tone. The lower the notes are, the lower the pitch. The duration of the notes (how long they are played for) is shown by making the note "heads" black or white, and by giving them stems and flags.</p>
<p>Music can also be written with letters, naming them as in the solfa "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do" or representing them by letters. The next table shows how each note of the solfa is represented in the <a href="/Standard_Notation" title="Standard Notation">Standard Notation</a>:</p>


<p>The Standard Notation was made to simplify the lecture of music notes, although it is mostly used to represent <a href="/Chord_(Music)" title="Chord (Music)">chords</a> and the names of the <a href="/Scale_(Music)" title="Scale (Music)">music scales</a>.</p>
<p>These ways to represent music ease the way a person reads music. There are more ways to write and represent music, but they are less known and may be more complicated.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_listening">By listening</span></h3>
<p>People can enjoy music by listening to it. They can go to <a href="/Concert" title="Concert">concerts</a> to hear musicians perform. <a href="/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a> is usually performed in <a href="/Concert_hall" title="Concert hall">concert halls</a>, but sometimes huge festivals are organized in which it is performed outside, in a field or stadium, like pop festivals. People can listen to music on <a href="/Compact_disc" title="Compact disc">CDs</a>, <a href="/PC" title="PC">Computers</a>, <a href="/IPod" title="IPod">iPods</a>, <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a>, the <a href="/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a>, <a href="/Cassette/record-player" title="Cassette/record-player">cassette/record-players</a> and even <a href="/Cell_phone" title="Cell phone">mobile phones</a>.</p>
<p>There is so much music today, in <a href="/Elevator" title="Elevator">elevators</a>, shopping <a href="/Mall" title="Mall">malls</a>, and <a href="/Shop" title="Shop">stores</a>, that it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_playing_or_singing">By playing or singing</span></h3>
<p>People can learn to play an instrument. Probably the most common for complete beginners is the <a href="/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a> or <a href="/Keyboard_instrument" title="Keyboard instrument">keyboard</a>, the <a href="/Guitar" title="Guitar">guitar</a>, or the <a href="/Recorder" title="Recorder">recorder</a> (which is certainly the cheapest to buy). After they have learnt to play <a href="/Scale_(music)" title="Scale (music)">scales</a>, play simple <a href="/Tune" title="Tune">tunes</a> and read the simplest <a href="/Musical_notation" title="Musical notation">musical notation</a>, then they can think about which instrument for further development. They should choose an instrument that is practical for their size. For example, a very short child cannot play a full size <a href="/Double_bass" title="Double bass">double bass</a>, because the double bass is over five feet high. People should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing, because playing regularly is the only way to get better. Finally, it helps to have a good <a href="/Teacher" title="Teacher">teacher</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_composing">By composing</span></h3>
<p>Anyone can make up his or her own pieces of music. It is not difficult to compose simple songs or melodies (tunes). It's easier for people who can play an instrument themselves. All it takes is experimenting with the sounds that an instrument makes. Someone can make up a piece that tells a story, or just find a nice tune and think about ways it can be changed each time it is repeated. The instrument might be someone's own voice.</p>
