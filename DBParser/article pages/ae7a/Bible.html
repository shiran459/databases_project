<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_it_was_written">How it was written</span></h2>
<p>For a long time the texts were passed on by word of mouth from <a href="/Generation" title="Generation">generation</a> to generation. The Bible was written long ago in <a href="/Aramaic_language" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic</a>, <a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, and <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>. Translations were made later into <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> and some other languages. Now there are translations in English and many other languages. The books of the Hebrew Bible—what Christians call the <a href="/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>—were not all written at the same time. It took hundreds of years (about 1200 years). The <a href="/Process" title="Process">process</a> of putting it all together began around 400 B.C. The <a href="/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, which was originally written in <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, began to be put together in about 100 <a href="/Anno_Domini" title="Anno Domini">A.D.</a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Translations_and_versions">Translations and versions</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="/Translation" title="Translation">translation</a> is when a <a href="/Scribe" title="Scribe">scribe</a> takes the <a href="/Source" title="Source">source</a> in one language and writes it in another <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a>. Most texts of the Bible were written in <a href="/Ancient_Greek_language" title="Ancient Greek language">Ancient Greek</a> or in <a href="/Aramaic_language" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic</a> or <a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>.</p>
<p>The first to provide a translation into <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> was <a href="/Jerome" title="Jerome">Jerome</a>, in the 5th century. He started what is known as the Vulgate today. <a href="/Wufila" title="Wufila">Wufila</a> translated the Bible into the <a href="/Gothic_language" title="Gothic language">Gothic</a> language. In the early Middle Ages, people such as <a href="/Petrus_Valdes" title="Petrus Valdes">Petrus Valdes</a>, and <a href="/Jan_Hus" title="Jan Hus">Jan Hus</a> provided translations.</p>
<p>The New Testament was first translated into English in 1382 by <a href="/John_Wycliffe" title="John Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a>, and his associates translated the Old Testament. The translation was made from the <a href="/Vulgate" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> Latin Bible. Wycliffe did this so that people could see for themselves what the Bible said. The translation was completed in 1382. There were some later editions by other people to the Wycliffe Bible, as it is called. It was translated into <a href="/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>, the language of his day. Wycliffe did not have Church permission to do this, but he was protected by <a href="/John_of_Gaunt" title="John of Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. After both Wycliffe and his protector were dead, the Church declared Wycliffe a <a href="/Heretic" title="Heretic">heretic</a> in 1415, and banned his writings. The <a href="/Council_of_Constance" title="Council of Constance">Council of Constance</a> decreed Wycliffe's works should be burned and his remains exhumed (dug up). Why was the Church so opposed? The translations challenged the Church's authority over the people. In church, explaining the Bible was the priest's work. Whatever he said could not be challenged. Once the ordinary people could read the Bible, they might have other opinions.</p>
<p>The next step in translation was done in 1525 by <a href="/William_Tyndale" title="William Tyndale">William Tyndale</a>. His translation was into <a href="/Early_Modern_English" title="Early Modern English">Early Modern English</a>, which we can just about understand today. Tyndale also did it without Church permission. His was the first translation to be <a href="/Print" title="Print">printed</a>, and several thousand copies were made. He had no protector, and his fate was terrible. He fled to Europe, but the agents of <a href="/Thomas_More" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a> (Chancellor of England at the time) eventually found him. Both Tyndale and his printer were executed by burning at the stake.</p>
<p>Another well known translation is the 1611 King James translation (commonly known as the Authorized King James Version of the Bible).</p>
<p>Some texts were written by <a href="/Historian" title="Historian">historians</a> who tried to show what <a href="/History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah" title="History of ancient Israel and Judah">Ancient Israel</a> was like. Other texts are <a href="/Poem" title="Poem">poems</a> about <a href="/God" title="God">God</a> and his work. And others were used to make <a href="/Law" title="Law">laws</a>. Followers of Judaism and Christianity consider the Bible <a href="/Sacred" title="Sacred">sacred</a> but they do not all agree about what belongs in the Bible. What is considered part of the Bible changed with history. Different <a href="/Christian_denomination" title="Christian denomination">denominations</a> include certain parts or leave out other parts. There is not one single version of the Bible; both the content of the books and their order may change.</p>
<p>Languages do not match. When a translation is done, the translator has to decide between translation word for word, or capturing the sense of the text. When he decides to capture the sense, he will choose other words in the target language. This is called paraphrasing. </p>
<p>Today there are <a href="/Dozen" title="Dozen">dozens</a> of <a href="/Version" title="Version">versions</a> of the Bible. Some are translations and some are paraphrases. A paraphrased version is where people take a translation and put it in their own words. As the Bible has been translated into modern languages, it is also possible that there are different translations of the same texts. The Bible is the best selling book of all time. 2.5 billion to more than 6 billion copies of the Bible have been sold to date.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-RussellAsh"><a href="#_note-RussellAsh" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> A complete version of the Bible exists in 471 languages.

<p>{{main|Old Testament}}
The Christian Bible is a collection of 66 books. The first 39 books are the Old Testament. It is the first part of the God's story of salvation. "Salvation" is God's long work of saving us from our sins. "Sin" is what happened when people decided to live their own way instead of God's way in the world that God created. That was when God began His great work of saving us from our sins. 
To prepare the way, God had to destroy the whole world by a great flood, except for the family of Noah. Then God raised up a new people for Himself. They were the ancient Hebrews. God promised the Hebrews they would bring His salvation to the whole world. 
The first five books of the Old Testament are mostly the story of how God chose the ancient Hebrews and taught them his laws. Following these are the twelve books that tell the history of the Hebrews. The next five are books of poetry and wisdom. One of these five books, the "Psalms", is a book of songs showing mainly how God wants to be worshiped. 
The last seventeen books of the Old Testament were written by Hebrew prophets. These books tell about God's disappointment with the ancient Hebrews and His promise to bring them back to friendship with Him. The prophets also foretell a great surprise God was planning for the world-He was going to send His very own Son, the Messiah (the "Anointed One"), the Saviour, to save us from our sins.
You can read about this Messiah in the New Testament.
In the Old Testament, <a href="/Tanakh" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> was mostly written in <a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>; a few parts were written in <a href="/Aramaic" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>. This part of the Bible is considered to be holy by <a href="/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a> as well as Christians.</p>
<p>There are also a few books of the Old Testament's time called <a href="/Deuterocanonical" title="Deuterocanonical">Deuterocanonical</a> by those Churches that accept them as part of the Bible, and <a href="/Apocrypha" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a> by those that do not.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Testament">New Testament</span></h2>
<p>{{main|New Testament}}
The second part is called the New Testament. The main part of this book is the story of the life of <a href="/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. The four different versions of this story in the New Testament are called the <a href="/Gospel" title="Gospel">Gospels</a>. After the Gospels, there is also the story of what happened to the <a href="/Church" title="Church">Church</a> after Jesus's death. Part of this is told through letters by early Christian leaders, especially <a href="/Saint_Paul" title="Saint Paul">Saint Paul</a>. One of the most quoted verses in the Bible is <a href="/John_3:16" title="John 3:16">John 3:16</a>: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." <sup><a href="/New_International_Version" title="New International Version">New International Version</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Views_about_the_Bible">Views about the Bible</span></h2>
<p>People have different ideas about the Bible. Christians believe it is God's Word to people. The Jews believe that only the Old Testament is from God. Protestants and Catholics believe that the Old and New Testaments are God's Word. Catholics also believe that the books called Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical are part of the Bible. Sometimes different <a href="/Christian_denomination" title="Christian denomination">denominations</a> disagree over exactly what the Bible means.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, much of the Bible is true, but the <a href="/Koran" title="Koran">Koran</a> is better.</p>
<p><a href="/Atheist" title="Atheist">Atheists</a> do not believe that gods exist, so the Bible is an ancient book about a religion.</p>
<p><a href="/Deist" title="Deist">Deists</a> believe in God, but they believe that the Bible was written by people, so they don't see it as so important.</p>
