<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Name">Name</span></h2>
<p>"The Netherlands" means "the low lands". The land only rises, on average, 1 meter above the sea level. One third of the land is below sea level. The Netherlands is also - incorrectly - referred to as <a href="/Holland" title="Holland">Holland</a>. Holland was a very rich area (two provinces) in the western part of the Netherlands, thus causing people to be mistaken. Some people who do not live in the western part of the Netherlands do not like it when people call the country Holland. The name "Holland" originates from the old Dutch words "Holt land" which means "wood lands".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>At the end of the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="/Duke" title="Duke">dukes</a> of <a href="/Burgundy" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, a country that is now part of <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>, united seventeen areas. Those areas were called the Netherlands. When the daughter of a duke married <a href="/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor</a> in 1477, the Netherlands became part of <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. In the 16th century many Dutch people became <a href="/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>. The king of Spain did not like it, he wanted all Dutch to be <a href="/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. He decided that all Protestants should be killed. Of course the Dutch people did not like this, and in 1568 they started a war against Spain. The war lasted until 1648, therefore it is called the <a href="/Eighty_Years'_War" title="Eighty Years' War">Eighty Years' War</a>. An important leader of the Dutch in this war was Willem van Oranje (Willem of orange) also called <a href="/William_the_Silent" title="William the Silent">William the Silent</a>.</p>
<p>In 1648 the Netherlands and Spain signed <a href="/Peace_of_M%C3%BCnster" title="Peace of Münster">peace</a>. The Dutch people were allowed to keep all the areas they conquered. The part of the Netherlands that was not conquered by the Dutch stayed part of Spain. Later this part became the country <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>When the Netherlands became independent, it was a very special country. That time almost all countries in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> were ruled by a king, but the Netherlands was a <a href="/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a>. The Netherlands was made up of seven <a href="/Province" title="Province">provinces</a>, that were ruled by the big cities. The cities where ruled by the municipality which consisted from rich civilians. Together those provinces were ruled by a <a href="/Stadtholder" title="Stadtholder">stadtholder</a>, a very powerful man, but compared to the kings of other European countries he had much less power.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/17th_century" title="17th century">17th century</a> the Netherlands was the richest and one of the most powerful countries in the world. Therefore, the Dutch call the 17th century the <a href="/Golden_Age" title="Golden Age">Golden Age</a>.  Their <a href="/Dutch_Empire" title="Dutch Empire">Dutch Empire</a> had possessions around the world.  The most important possession were the <a href="/East_Indies" title="East Indies">East Indies</a>, a country that is now called <a href="/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.  The Dutch also founded <a href="/New_Netherland" title="New Netherland">New Netherland</a>, which is now called <a href="/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>.  The Netherlands often fought wars against other European countries, especially the <a href="/Anglo-Dutch_Wars" title="Anglo-Dutch Wars">Anglo-Dutch Wars</a> against <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. <a href="/Michiel_de_Ruyter" title="Michiel de Ruyter">Michiel de Ruyter</a>, a Dutch <a href="/Admiral" title="Admiral">admiral</a>, became a Dutch hero when he defeated the English navy close to London.</p>
<p>In the 18th century the Netherlands became poorer. Many people blamed this on the government leaders, the stadtholders. Many thought they had too much power and wanted them to get away. In 1789 the French people <a href="/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">deposed</a> (got rid of) their king. French armies attacked other countries to depose their leaders too. In 1795 they attacked the Netherlands. Stadtholder <a href="/Stadtholder_William_V_of_the_Netherlands" title="Stadtholder William V of the Netherlands">William V</a> had to flee to England. The Netherlands were renamed to <a href="/Batavian_Republic" title="Batavian Republic">Batavian Republic</a> and became a <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. But the French were not content (satisfied) with the Dutch ruler, so in 1806 the French <a href="/Emperor" title="Emperor">emperor</a> <a href="/Napoleon" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> made his brother <a href="/Louis_Bonaparte" title="Louis Bonaparte">Louis Bonaparte</a> king of the Netherlands. Louis became popular in the Netherlands, but the emperor was again not content with him, so in 1810 the Netherlands became a part of France.</p>
<p>In 1815 Napoleon was defeated, and the Netherlands became independent again. The rulers of European countries thought it was a good idea to make the Netherlands stronger, to make them able to resist another French invasion. Therefore, <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="/Luxembourg" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> were added to the Netherlands. <a href="/King_William_I_of_the_Netherlands" title="King William I of the Netherlands">William I</a>, the son of stadtholder William V, became king. The Belgians disliked their Dutch king. In 1830 they revolted. William sent an army. He was much more powerful than the Belgians but after ten days the French sent an army to support them. In 1831 the Belgians chose their own king and Belgium became an independent country.</p>
<p><a href="/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">Some people</a> again thought the Dutch king had too much power. They wanted to give him less power and vote for the government themselves. In 1848 there were violent revolts against the kings of many European countries. The Dutch king was afraid the same would happen in the Netherlands. Therefore, he allowed <a href="/Johan_Rudolf_Thorbecke" title="Johan Rudolf Thorbecke">Johan Rudolf Thorbecke</a> to write a <a href="/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a>. From then on people were allowed to vote. At first only rich men were allowed to vote. From 1919 on <a href="/Universal_suffrage" title="Universal suffrage">everyone was allowed to vote</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the Netherlands did not fight. The Dutch wanted to stay <a href="/Neutrality_(international_relations)" title="Neutrality (international relations)">neutral</a> in <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> as well, but in 1940 the country was invaded and occupied by <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Like in other countries they had occupied, the National Socialist Party started to kill <a href="/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a>. <a href="/Anne_Frank" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> was a Jewish girl who lived in the Netherlands. Her family hid from the Nazis and she wrote a <a href="/Diary" title="Diary">diary</a>. She died in a Nazi <a href="/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a> and her diary became famous.</p>
<p>In 1944 the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">American</a>, <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canadian</a>, <a href="/Poland" title="Poland">Polish</a> and British armies liberated the south of the Netherlands from Nazi Occupation. They wanted to cross the <a href="/Rhine" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> river in <a href="/Operation_Market_Garden" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a> to liberate the rest of the country, but they were defeated. It took until May 1945 before the entire country was liberated. During the five years of Nazi occupation, 250,000 people had died in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Shortly after the war, <a href="/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> declared its independence. The Dutch sent soldiers to fight in Indonesia. During the war the Dutch realized how it is to be occupied by another country, so some thought they should not do the same to the Indonesians. After other countries, including the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, told the Dutch to leave Indonesia, they finally did so in 1949.</p>
<p>After the war the Netherlands became one of the richest countries in the world. In 2004 the <a href="/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> said that the Netherlands was the 5th best country to live in.</p>

<p>In fact a large part of the Netherlands was created by the sand that came from the many <a href="/River" title="River">rivers</a> flowing through it.

A large part of the Netherlands is below <a href="/Sea_level" title="Sea level">sea level</a>. This is because the Dutch have made many lakes and parts of the sea dry, creating polders. Therefore, there is a <a href="/Saying" title="Saying">saying</a> "God created the earth, but the Dutch created the Netherlands." This makes the Netherlands very flat. In the very south-east of the Netherlands, in <a href="/Limburg_(Netherlands)" title="Limburg (Netherlands)">Limburg</a>, there are some hills.

The highest point in the European portion of the Netherlands, the <a href="/Vaalserberg" title="Vaalserberg">Vaalserberg</a>, is 323 metres above sea level. The highest point in both the Netherlands proper and the Kingdom of the Netherlands is <a href="/Mount_Scenery" title="Mount Scenery">Mount Scenery</a>, on the Caribbean island of <a href="/Saba" title="Saba">Saba</a>, at 887 metres.</p>
