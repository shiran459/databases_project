<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="BBC_Charter">BBC Charter</span></h2>
<p>The BBC is <a href="/Establish" title="Establish">established</a> under a <a href="/Royal_Charter" title="Royal Charter">Royal Charter</a>, which allows the BBC to broadcast. In 2006{{cn}}, the <a href="/British_Government" title="British Government">British Government</a> looked at the charter to see if it needed changing.</p>
<p>Another <a href="/Agreement" title="Agreement">agreement</a>, which goes with the Charter, recognises that the BBC should be <a href="/Independent" title="Independent">independent</a> from any other organisation. It also says what the BBC should do for the people in Britain (the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/public">public</a>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Finance">Finance</span></h3>
<p>Every household in the UK that watches or records "live" programmes, (as they’re being broadcast, or distributed to the public in any other way) are required, by law, to pay for a <a href="/TV_Licence" title="TV Licence">TV Licence</a>. As the BBC gets its money from TV licences, it does not take money from <a href="/Company" title="Company">companies</a> or <a href="/Shareholder" title="Shareholder">shareholders</a>, so it does not have to do what they want. Also, it is not allowed to broadcast <a href="/Advertising" title="Advertising">commercials</a>.</p>
<p>The BBC makes extra money in several ways. One way is by selling its programmes to other broadcasting companies. Another way is by selling audio tapes and <a href="/Compact_disc" title="Compact disc">CDs</a> of its best radio programmes, and <a href="/VHS" title="VHS">videos</a> and <a href="/DVD" title="DVD">DVDs</a> of its best television programmes. Still another way is by selling books based on programmes, and magazines about science and natural history.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Radio_Times"><i>Radio Times</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1923, <a href="/BBC_Magazines" title="BBC Magazines">BBC Magazines</a> started publishing a <a href="/Magazine" title="Magazine">magazine</a> which printed listings of the week's BBC radio and television programmes in the United Kingdom. The magazine was called the <i>Radio Times</i>. In 1991, the magazine began to print listings of programmes broadcast by other providers in the United Kingdom. Today the magazine is still printed and provides <a href="/Online" title="Online">online</a> listings too. It also prints stories about programmes, the people who make them, and the people who appear in them. The <i>Radio Times</i> is one of the best selling magazines in the United Kingdom. In August 2011, the BBC agreed to sell the magazine to Exponent, if Britain's <a href="/Office_of_Fair_Trading" title="Office of Fair Trading">Office of Fair Trading</a> approves.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="BBC_Report">BBC Report</span></h2>
<p>The BBC has to publish a <a href="/Report" title="Report">report</a> every year, which tells people what it has done and how much money it has made and spent.</p>
<p>If someone has a complaint about something broadcast by the BBC, they can complain to the BBC, the BBC Trust, or directly to <a href="/Ofcom" title="Ofcom">Ofcom</a>, the government's <a href="/Regulator" title="Regulator">regulator</a> of broadcasting.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Locations">Locations</span></h2>
<p>The headquarters of the BBC is <a href="/Broadcasting_House" title="Broadcasting House">Broadcasting House</a> in Portland Place, <a href="/London" title="London">London</a>. The BBC also has other offices such as the <a href="/BBC_Television_Centre" title="BBC Television Centre">BBC Television Centre</a> in White City, London, as well in other cities like Cardiff, Belfast, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Southampton and Newcastle upon Tyne. Rather than hire local reporters everywhere, the BBC's journalists work in many countries across the world. This means BBC workers are sometimes in danger, especially in war zones. Most recently <a href="/Alan_Johnston" title="Alan Johnston">Alan Johnston</a> was kidnapped and held hostage for many months in <a href="/Gaza" title="Gaza">Gaza</a> before being safely released.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="BBC_iPlayer">BBC iPlayer</span></h2>
<p>{{main|BBC iPlayer}}
Between October 2005 and 28 February 2006, the BBC offered a service called the BBC iPlayer on their website - <a href="/Bbc.co.uk" title="Bbc.co.uk">bbc.co.uk</a>. It allowed people to catch up on the last seven days of TV and radio on the BBC. Users could either watch (stream) it or <a href="/Download" title="Download">download</a> the content on their <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>. The downloading options are for <a href="/Microsoft_Windows" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> computers and Apple devices. The iPlayer service was released to the public on 25 December 2007. The slogan for BBC iPlayer is 'Making the Unmissable, Unmissable.'</p>
