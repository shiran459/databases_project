<p>A <b>leap year</b> is a <a href="/Year" title="Year">year</a> in which an extra <a href="/Day" title="Day">day</a> is added to the <a href="/Gregorian_calendar" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, which is used by most of the world. While an ordinary year has 365 <a href="/Day" title="Day">days</a>, a leap year has 366 days. The extra day, <a href="/February_29" title="February 29">February 29</a>, is added to the <a href="/Month" title="Month">month</a> of <a href="/February" title="February">February</a>. In an ordinary year, February has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29 days. The extra 29th day, called a leap day, is the same day of the week as the first day of the month, <a href="/February_1" title="February 1">February 1</a>. Also, in a leap year, the months of <a href="/January" title="January">January</a>, <a href="/April" title="April">April</a>, and <a href="/July" title="July">July</a> all start on the same day of the week.</p>
<p>A leap year comes once every four years. Because of this, a leap year can always be evenly <a href="/Division_(mathematics)" title="Division (mathematics)">divided</a> by four. For example, <a href="/2012" title="2012">2012</a> was a leap year. But a year is rather a common year if it can be evenly divided by 100 but not by 400. This is why <a href="/1600" title="1600">1600</a>, <a href="/2000" title="2000">2000</a>, and <a href="/2400" title="2400">2400</a> are leap years, but <a href="/1700" title="1700">1700</a>, <a href="/1800" title="1800">1800</a>, and <a href="/1900" title="1900">1900</a> were rather common years.</p>
<p>We have leap years because instead of 365 days, the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> really takes a few minutes less than 365-1/4 days (365.24219) to go completely around the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>. Without leap years, the <a href="/Season" title="Season">seasons</a> would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years. After 360 years, spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere (which usually begins on March 21) would begin on December 21 (which is when winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere presently begins).</p>
<p>A number of countries use a <a href="/Lunar_calendar" title="Lunar calendar">lunar calendar</a> (based on the <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">moon</a>, instead of the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>, like our <a href="/Solar_calendar" title="Solar calendar">solar calendar</a> is). They have leap years when they add an extra lunar month. Different calendars add the extra month in different ways.</p>
