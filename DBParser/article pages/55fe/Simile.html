<p>A <b>simile</b> is a <a href="/Figure_of_speech" title="Figure of speech">figure of speech</a> that compares two different things, usually by using the words 'like' or 'as'. It is used to make a <i>direct <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comparison">comparison</a></i>. Similes may be confused with <a href="/Metaphor" title="Metaphor">metaphors</a>, which do the same kind of thing. Similes use comparisons, with the words '<a href="/Like" title="Like">like</a>' or 'as'. Metaphors use indirect comparisons, without the words 'like' or 'as'.</p>
