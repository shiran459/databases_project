<p>In the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, people use inches more than they use <a href="/Millimetre" title="Millimetre">millimetres</a> or <a href="/Centimetre" title="Centimetre">centimetres</a>. In the rest of the world, <a href="/International_System_of_Units" title="International System of Units">international units</a> are almost always used. The inch is not used by scientists.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, <a href="/Traffic_sign" title="Traffic sign">road signs</a> that show how high a vehicle can be in order to pass through a <a href="/Tunnel" title="Tunnel">tunnel</a> are required to be in feet and inches. <a href="/Theme_park" title="Theme park">Theme parks</a> and <a href="/Drive-through" title="Drive-through">drive thru</a> signs usually show it in metres. People regularly measure their <a href="/Height" title="Height">height</a> in feet and inches. Official medical records, however, are required to record people's height in <a href="/Metric_system" title="Metric system">metric</a> measurements only.</p>
<p>In Canada, a mix of centimetres and inches are used in height. Older generations, especially, use Imperial units. A lot of exposure to <a href="/Americanisation" title="Americanisation">Americanized</a> phrases leads to younger generations often having a good understanding of both the Imperial and metric systems.</p>
<p>In the United States, height is always in feet and inches. Science is the only field to use metric measurements.</p>
