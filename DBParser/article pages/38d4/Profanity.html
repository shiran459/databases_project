<p><b>Profanity</b> is the act of using swear words. The <a href="/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjective</a> is 'profane'. Profanities can also be called curse ("cuss") words, dirty words, bad words, foul language, obscenity, obscene language, or expletives. It can be called an oath, although this word also has a normal meaning of a "solemn promise".  </p>
<p>Religious profanity is called <a href="/Blasphemy" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a>.  The <a href="/Verb" title="Verb">verb</a> is to blaspheme and the <a href="/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjective</a> is 'blasphemous'. Saying “God!” or “Jesus Christ!” as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many people to be blasphemy, mostly because one of the <a href="/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> says not to use God's name "in vain" (without substance or without relevance). Swearing oaths can also be considered wrong by some who follow Jesus' teaching against swearing oaths in the <a href="/Gospel" title="Gospel">Gospels</a> (such as Matthew 5:34).</p>
<p>A profanity usually refers to <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a>, <a href="/Sex" title="Sex">sex</a>, or bodily functions. These are things that people feel very strongly about. In some languages, such as <a href="/French_language" title="French language">French</a>, there is more profanity about religion than most other topics.</p>
<p>A profanity can be a word or <a href="/Gesture" title="Gesture">gesture</a> or some other form of behaviour.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Different words can be profanity to different people, and what words are thought of as profanity in English can change over time.</p>
<p>Whether a word is a profanity will always depend on the way people think. Some people will be offended by something, while others will not be. Words which should not be used are <a href="/Taboo" title="Taboo">taboo</a> words. Using such words is thought by some people to be a <a href="/Sin" title="Sin">sin</a>. For example, some <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christians</a>, (including <a href="/Mormons" title="Mormons">Mormons</a>) and some <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Muslims</a> believe that swearing is a sin.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Opinions_on_profanity">Opinions on profanity</span></h2>
<p>Some people call profanity "crude," but some say that it is no cruder to say "damn" or "crap" than it is to use "hate" (a word that simply creates a very strong <a href="/Emotions" title="Emotions">emotion</a>, but not a swear word). People who use profanity do not always mean to make anybody feel bad, and tolerance for different forms of profanity can vary widely, from person to person. Most often, using profanity is a verbal outlet for strong feelings (usually unpleasant ones), that might otherwise cause a physical reaction. At other times, some people may use profanity as <a href="/Humor" title="Humor">humor</a>.</p>
