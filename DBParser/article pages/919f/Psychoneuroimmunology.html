<p>Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.</p>
<p><a href="/Claude_Bernard" title="Claude Bernard">Claude Bernard</a>, a French physiologist, founded the concept <a href="/Milieu_interieur" title="Milieu interieur">milieu interieur</a> in the mid 1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state “… there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism." (Bernard, 1865) </p>
<p><a href="/Walter_Cannon" title="Walter Cannon">Walter Cannon</a>, a professor of physiology at <a href="/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> coined the term <a href="/Homeostasis" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a> in his book <i>The Wisdom of the Body</i> in 1932. In his work with animals Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as <a href="/Anxiety" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a>, <a href="/Distress" title="Distress">distress</a>, or <a href="/Rage_(emotion)" title="Rage (emotion)">rage</a> was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage, 1915). These studies into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the <a href="/Autonomic_nervous_system" title="Autonomic nervous system">autonomic nervous system</a>, the  responses that led to the <a href="/Fight_or_flight_response" title="Fight or flight response">freeze, fight or flight response</a>.  </p>

<p>In 1975 Robert Ader and Nicholas Cohen advanced PNI with a demonstration of classic conditioning of the immune function, and coined the term "psychoneuroimmunology".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-roch"><a href="#_note-roch" title="">[3]</a></sup> Ader was investigating how long <a href="/Conditioned_response" title="Conditioned response">conditioned responses</a>  might last in laboratory rats. The highly reproducible results showed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were immuno suppressed. In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.</p>
<p>In 1981 David Felten, then working at the <a href="/Indiana_University" title="Indiana University">Indiana University</a> of Medicine, discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system. The researchers also found nerves in the <a href="/Thymus" title="Thymus">thymus</a> and <a href="/Spleen" title="Spleen">spleen</a> terminating near clusters of <a href="/Lymphocyte" title="Lymphocyte">lymphocytes</a>, <a href="/Macrophage" title="Macrophage">macrophages</a> and <a href="/Mast_cell" title="Mast cell">mast cells</a>, all of which help control immune function. This discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro-immune interaction occurs.</p>
<p>Ader, Cohen and Felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book <i>Psychoneuroimmunology</i> in 1981, which laid out the underlying premise that the brain and immune system represent a single, integrated system of defense.</p>

<p>Stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, for example, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – the death of a spouse.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Kaprio.2C_J._1987"><a href="#_note-Kaprio.2C_J._1987" title="">[4]</a></sup> Theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which, in turn, induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes.
