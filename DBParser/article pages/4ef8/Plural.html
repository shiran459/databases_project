<p>The <b>plural</b> of a <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a> shows the number of that <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a> is more than one.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Singular" title="Singular">singular</a> form of a <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a> shows the quantity of that <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a> is one. </p>
<p>In many languages, a <a href="/Suffix" title="Suffix">suffix</a> (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In the <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> language, the <a href="/Suffix" title="Suffix">suffix</a> <i>-s</i> is used to indicate that a <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a> has been turned into its plural form (<a href="/Inflection" title="Inflection">inflection</a>). Here is an example: <i>cat</i> is a singular <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a>, but <i>cat<b>s</b></i> is a plural <a href="/Noun" title="Noun">noun</a>. </p>

<li>Singulars ending in <u>s</u> are usually the same in plural: <i>species</i>, <i>mumps</i>, <i>innings</i> and so on. But proper names ending in 's' take add 'es' in plural: <i>Jones</i> becomes <i>the Joneses</i>. </li>
<li>Compound words add the plural to the noun part: <u>sons</u>-in-law, Lord <u>Mayors</u>, <u>Courts</u> Martial<i>.</i></li>
<li>Singulars ending in <u>y</u> become <u>ies</u> in plural if a <a href="/Consonant" title="Consonant">consonant</a> is before the suffix. So <u>day</u> becomes <u>days</u>, but <u>spy</u> becomes <u>spies</u>. Personal names are again an exception: the plural of <u>Mary</u> is <u>Marys</u>.</li>
<li>Singulars ending in <u>f</u> usually changes to <u>ves</u>: dwarf to dwarves, leaf to leaves, and so on.</li>
<li>Special cases: some plurals just have to be learnt. The plural of <i>person</i> is normally <i>people</i>, but sometimes <i>persons</i> is used.</li>
<li>Invariant nouns: <br/>The <a href="/Common_name" title="Common name">common names</a> of animals is often used as both singular and plural. One can say "We shot grouse today" correctly no matter what number were killed. With "fish" there is a choice. Traditional English usage is that the word is used for both singular and plural, but American usage seems to prefer <u>fishes</u> as the plural. <br/>With groups of animals, one uses the singular, as in a herd of bison or a <a href="/Shoal" title="Shoal">shoal</a> of herring. But if the animals are known as individuals then, for example, we feed the ducks, or stroke our cats. There are other cases where there is no plural at all, as with sheep, salmon, deer. <br/>Other general words which add no suffix in plural are <i>aircraft</i> and <i>offspring</i>. Some look like singular but are always plural, such as <i>vermin</i>, <i>livestock</i>, <i>cattle</i>, <i>people</i>.  </li>

<p>It is fair to say that most native English speakers do make mistakes in this area: it is one of the more troublesome aspects of the English language.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_languages">Other languages</span></h2>
<p>All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each one of these other languages is different from the suffix that is applied to <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> nouns.</p>
<p>In such <a href="/East_Asia" title="East Asia">East Asian</a> languages as <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, <a href="/Korean_language" title="Korean language">Korean</a> and <a href="/Japanese_language" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>, there is no plural ending. Native speakers of these languages usually fail to inflex <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> nouns into their plural forms.</p>
