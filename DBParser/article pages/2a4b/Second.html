<p>The <b>second</b> (symbol: <b>s</b>), sometimes abbreviated <b>sec.</b>, is the name of a <a href="/Units_of_measurement" title="Units of measurement">unit</a> of <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a>. It is one of the seven <a href="/SI_base_unit" title="SI base unit">SI base units</a>. It is the time taken by 9,192,631,770 <a href="/Cycle" title="Cycle">cycles</a> of <a href="/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a> that comes from <a href="/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a> moving between two <a href="/Energy_level" title="Energy level">energy levels</a> of the <a href="/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a>-133 <a href="/Atom" title="Atom">atom</a>.</p>
<p>Other (non-SI) units of time are defined in terms of the second. There are 86,400 seconds in one <a href="/Day" title="Day">day</a>, 3,600 seconds in one <a href="/Hour" title="Hour">hour</a>, and 60 seconds in one <a href="/Minute" title="Minute">minute</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/SI_prefixes" title="SI prefixes">SI prefixes</a> are frequently combined with the word <i>second</i> to denote subdivisions of the second, <i>e.g.</i>, the <a href="/Millisecond" title="Millisecond">millisecond</a> (one thousandth of a second) and <a href="/Nanosecond" title="Nanosecond">nanosecond</a> (one billionth of a second). Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second (such as “kilosecond”, or one thousand seconds), such units are rarely used in practice. More commonly encountered, non-SI units of time such as the <a href="/Minute" title="Minute">minute</a>, <a href="/Hour" title="Hour">hour</a>, and <a href="/Day" title="Day">day</a> increase by multiples of 60 and 24 (rather than by powers of ten as in the SI system).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_origin">Historical origin</span></h2>
<p>Originally, the second was known as a "second minute", meaning the second minute (i.e. small) division of an hour. The first division was known as a "prime minute" and is equivalent to the <a href="/Minute" title="Minute">minute</a> we know today.</p>
<p>The factor of 60 comes from the <a href="/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylonians</a> who used factors of 60 in their counting system. However, the Babylonians did not subdivide their time units sexagesimally (except for the day). The <a href="/Hour" title="Hour">hour</a> had been defined by the <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptians</a> as either 1/12 of daytime or 1/12 of nighttime, hence both varied with the seasons. <a href="/Hellenistic" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> astronomers, including <a href="/Hipparchus" title="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> and <a href="/Ptolemy" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, defined the hour as 1/24 of a mean <a href="/Solar_time" title="Solar time">solar day</a>. Sexagesimally subdividing this mean solar hour made the second 1/86,400 of a mean solar day.{{fact|date=April 2007|it's rather unlikely the ancients defined the second this way - which placing it here suggests}} Hellenistic time periods like the mean <a href="/Synodic_month" title="Synodic month">synodic month</a> were usually specified quite precisely because they were <i>calculated</i> from carefully selected <a href="/Eclipse" title="Eclipse">eclipses</a> separated by hundreds of years—individual <i>mean</i> synodic months and similar time periods cannot be <i>measured</i>. Nevertheless, with the development of <a href="/Pendulum" title="Pendulum">pendulum</a> clocks keeping <i>mean time</i> (as opposed to the <i>apparent time</i> displayed by sundials), the second became measurable. The seconds pendulum was proposed as a unit of length as early as 1660 by the <a href="/Royal_Society_of_London" title="Royal Society of London">Royal Society of London</a>. The duration of a beat or half period (one swing, not back and forth) of a pendulum one <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">metre</a> in length on the Earth's surface is approximately one second.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1956 the second was defined in terms of the period of revolution of the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> around the Sun for a particular <a href="/Epoch_(astronomy)" title="Epoch (astronomy)">epoch</a>, because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation on its own axis was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time. The Earth's motion was described in <a href="/Newcomb's_Tables_of_the_Sun" title="Newcomb's Tables of the Sun">Newcomb's Tables of the Sun</a>, which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-USNO_c"><a href="#_note-USNO" title="">[1]</a></sup> The second thus defined is</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the <a href="/Tropical_year" title="Tropical year">tropical year</a> for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time.</i><sup class="reference" id="_ref-USNO_d"><a href="#_note-USNO" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>

<p>This definition was ratified by the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. The <i>tropical year</i> in the definition was not measured, but calculated from a formula describing a tropical year which decreased linearly over time, hence the curious reference to a specific <i>instantaneous</i> tropical year. Because this second was the independent variable of time used in <a href="/Ephemeris" title="Ephemeris">ephemerides</a> of the Sun and Moon during most of the twentieth century (Newcomb's Tables of the Sun were used from 1900 through 1983, and <a href="/Ernest_William_Brown" title="Ernest William Brown">Brown</a>'s Tables of the Moon were used from 1920 through 1983), it was called the ephemeris second.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-USNO_e"><a href="#_note-USNO" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the development of the <a href="/Atomic_clock" title="Atomic clock">atomic clock</a>, it was decided to use atomic clocks as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.</p>
<p>Following several years of work, <a href="/Louis_Essen" title="Louis Essen">Louis Essen</a> from the <a href="/National_Physical_Laboratory" title="National Physical Laboratory">National Physical Laboratory</a> (Teddington, England) and <a href="/William_Markowitz" title="William Markowitz">William Markowitz</a> from the <a href="/United_States_Naval_Observatory" title="United States Naval Observatory">United States Naval Observatory</a> (USNO) determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the <a href="/Caesium" title="Caesium">caesium</a> atom and the ephemeris second.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-USNO_f"><a href="#_note-USNO" title="">[1]</a></sup> Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from <a href="/Radio_station" title="Radio station">radio station</a> <a href="/WWV_(radio_station)" title="WWV (radio station)">WWV</a>,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> they determined the orbital motion of the <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. As a result, in 1967 the Thirteenth <a href="/Conf%C3%A9rence_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_des_Poids_et_Mesures" title="Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> defined the second of <a href="/International_Atomic_Time" title="International Atomic Time">atomic time</a> in the <a href="/SI" title="SI">International System of Units (SI)</a> as</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.</i><sup class="reference" id="_ref-USNO_g"><a href="#_note-USNO" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>

<p>The ground state is defined at zero <a href="/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a>. The second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-USNO_h"><a href="#_note-USNO" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The definition of the second was later refined at the 1997 meeting of the <a href="/Bureau_International_des_Poids_et_Mesures" title="Bureau International des Poids et Mesures">BIPM</a> to include the statement</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K.</i></dd>
</dl>

<p>The revised definition would seem to imply that the ideal atomic clock would contain a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency. In practice, however, the definition means that high-precision realizations of the second should compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature (<a href="/Black-body_radiation" title="Black-body radiation">black-body radiation</a>) within which atomic clocks operate and extrapolate accordingly to the value of the second as defined above.</p>

<p>Sometimes in <a href="/Role-playing_game" title="Role-playing game">role-playing games</a> a second is used to refer to a small period of time or a single turn of combat. It is used as a standard moment of time, and does not necessarily refer to a real second, and could be shorter or longer depending on the scenario.</p>

<ul>
<li>Until modern times, degrees and hours were divided successively by 60 in <i>pars minuta prima</i>, <i>pars minuta secunda</i>, <i>pars minuta tertia</i> and so on. This evolved to the modern minute and second, but for smaller divisions we follow now the decimal division. In some languages, dictionaries still keep the word for <i>third</i> for 1/60 of a second, for example Polish (<i>tercja</i>) and Arabic (ثالثة).</li>
