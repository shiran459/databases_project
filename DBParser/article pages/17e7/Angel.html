<ul>
<li><b>Cherubim</b> (plural of cherub) are described as "winged creatures" which have four wings<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Cherubim guard the <a href="/Garden_of_Eden" title="Garden of Eden">Eden</a> with a <a href="/Sword" title="Sword">sword</a> of fire.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. Genesis 3:24 is found in the <a href="/Book_of_Ezekiel" title="Book of Ezekiel">Book of Ezekiel</a>. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Ezekiel 28:13-14
13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.</p>
<p>It describes the sound of their wings, "like the roar of rushing waters."<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings .</p>
<p>Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have "straight feet" and four wings and four faces.</p>
<p>Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16</p>
<p>Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be "a wheel in the midst of a wheel" and that the color of the wheels was the color of "Amber" Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Seraphim</b> (plural of seraph, which means "burning")they also are depicted having wings, six of them. They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the <a href="/Temple" title="Temple">temple</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Archangels</b> like Gabriel (<a href="/Gospel_of_Luke" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered <a href="/Saint" title="Saint">saints</a> in the <a href="/Catholic_church" title="Catholic church">Catholic church</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ABF_b"><a href="#_note-ABF" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, in the King James Version of the Bible; they are another type of angel. In the <a href="/Book_of_Revelation" title="Book of Revelation">Book of Revelation</a> the Angel Michael casts the 'great dragon' <a href="/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a> out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels, just before the Great Judgement of angels and man. (Revelation 12)</li>
<li>The <a href="/Leviathan" title="Leviathan">Leviathan</a> in <a href="/Book_of_Job" title="Book of Job">Book of Job</a> 41:19-21 has flame that goes:  'out of his mouth' like a <a href="/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a>.  Isaiah 30:6 also talks of a 'fiery flying serpent'. Compare Revelation 20:2: , where an angel: 'laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the <a href="/Devil" title="Devil">Devil</a>, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years'.</li>

<p>They are often shown in art as having wings and a <a href="/Halo" title="Halo">halo</a>. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness.</p>
<p>The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings.</p>
<p>The cherubim statue or <a href="/Bronze" title="Bronze">bronze</a> casting of cherubim in the Temple of <a href="/Solomon" title="Solomon">Solomon</a> depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making.</p>
<p>The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the <a href="/Ark_of_the_Covenant" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>.
