<p>{{Further|Ancient Greece}}
</p>


<p>
<a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greece's history</a> is one of the richest in the world. The Greeks were one of the most advanced civilizations. Greece is famous for its many <a href="/Philosophers" title="Philosophers">philosophers</a>, like <a href="/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and kings like <a href="/Alexander_the_Great" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> and <a href="/Leonidas" title="Leonidas">Leonidas</a>. Greece is said to be the <i>birthplace of <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">Democracy</a></i>, because city-states like <a href="/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, now the capital of Greece, were the first to elect their leaders and not have <a href="/King" title="King">kings</a>. During the years of <a href="/Alexander_the_Great" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, a huge Greek empire was created that stretched from modern-day Greece to <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, until the borders of <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>. Because of the significant role that Greek culture played during that time, it is called the <a href="/Hellenistic" title="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> period (or <i>Greek-dominated period</i>). During that time, the <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> became the '<a href="/Lingua_franca" title="Lingua franca">lingua franca</a>' of the <a href="/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, which means the language that people who do not speak the same language use to communicate, like <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> is used today as an international language.</p>
<p>Greece was then ruled by the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and many argue that Rome conquered Greece with its army, but Greece conquered Rome with its culture. The Roman Empire after the conquest of Greece became a civilization known as the Greco-Roman (or Greek-Roman) civilization.  When the Roman Empire collapsed, the Greeks emerged as the ruling class of the <a href="/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, and the <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> became the official language of the empire, which included all the eastern <a href="/Mediterranean_Sea" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and other countries in the area.  It was then occupied by the <a href="/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> for a period of 400 years. Some areas of Greece, like the second-largest city in the country, <a href="/Thessaloniki" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, were occupied for 500 years and became part of Greece less than 100 years ago. 
</p>


<p>
The <a href="/Greek_War_of_Independence" title="Greek War of Independence">Greek War of Independence</a> began on the 25th of March 1821, according to tradition, and Greece was an independent country (a republic) in 1828. In reality, the Greek War of Independence began on 23 February 1821, when <a href="/Alexander_Ypsilantis" title="Alexander Ypsilantis">Alexander Ypsilantis</a><sup class="reference" id="_ref-test"><a href="#_note-test" title="">[6]</a></sup>(Greek Αλέξανδρος Υψηλάντης) declared the start of the revolution in modern-day <a href="/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>. In 1832 Greece was made a kingdom by the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, under the <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> Wittelsbach dynasty. </p>
<p>In 1912, Greece took part in the <a href="/Balkan_Wars" title="Balkan Wars">Balkan Wars</a>, where it gained many of the territories that make up the country now, such as <a href="/Greek_Macedonia" title="Greek Macedonia">Greek Macedonia</a> and the islands of the <a href="/Aegean_Sea" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. Greece fought in both <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> in the side of allies. In 1920 Greece expanded again, and briefly reached its maximum size. The territories that the country had gained in <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> were given back to Turkey in the 1923 <a href="/Treaty_of_Lausanne" title="Treaty of Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>, but Greece kept Western Thrace.</p>
<p>In 1940, Greece was invaded by <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, but managed to defeat the invasion. This was the first victory of an <a href="/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied country</a> against an <a href="/Axis_countries" title="Axis countries">Axis power</a>. After the defeat of <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/Hitler" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> decided to attack Greece sooner than he had planned. Germany invaded on <a href="/6_April" title="6 April">6 April</a> <a href="/1940" title="1940">1940</a> and captured Greece's second-largest city of <a href="/Thessaloniki" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> on 9 April, while Athens was captured on 27 April. Greece suffered major damages in the <a href="/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> and was involved in a <a href="/Civil_war" title="Civil war">civil war</a> between 1946 and 1949, which left the country devastated and the people very poor. The Greek civil war was fought between the <a href="/Communists" title="Communists">communists</a> and the people who supported the <a href="/King" title="King">king</a>, who also had support from the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>In 1967 the military took control of the country and restricted democracy. Free elections were then held again 7 years later, and the Greeks voted to send the <a href="/King" title="King">king</a> away and declared a <a href="/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a> in 1974. Greece became a member of the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> in 1981. Greece had seen rapid growth in the 1990s, but some of the country's economic statistics were modified to appear more correct than they were, as the government had lied with the help of banks from the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. In 2004, Greece hosted the <a href="/Olympic_Games" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> for a second time. Since 2009, Greece has been in an economic crisis, which is also becoming a political crisis.</p>

<p>
Greece is not a federal state like the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, but a <a href="/Unitary_state" title="Unitary state">unitary state</a> like the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.  It  is ruled by a <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">parliament</a>, called the <i>Hellenic Parliament</i> (or <i>Greek Parliament</i> in Simple English), which has 300 members. It is a <a href="/Parliamentary_republic" title="Parliamentary republic">parliamentary republic</a>, which means that, unlike in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="/President" title="President">President</a> has very few powers. The person in charge of the government of Greece is the <a href="/Prime_Minister" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a>. </p>
<p>Greece was a kingdom for most of its history as an independent nation. It officially became the <i>Third Hellenic Republic</i> (or <i>Third Republic of Greece</i> in Simple English) in 1975, when the monarchy was abolished by a popular vote.</p>
<p>During <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Greece was divided into two countries, the <a href="/State_of_Thessaloniki" title="State of Thessaloniki">State of Thessaloniki</a> in the north and the <a href="/State_of_Athens" title="State of Athens">State of Athens</a> in the south.  Both countries claimed to be the legitimate government of Greece, but the State of Thessaloniki received support from the Allies.  The country was reunited in 1917, when the King abdicated.  Greece was under a <a href="/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascist</a> <a href="/Dictatorship" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> from 1936 until 1941, when it was invaded by <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.  Greece was under a <a href="/Military_dictatorship" title="Military dictatorship">military dictatorship</a> between 1967 and 1975.  Demonstrations by the students of the universities across Greece took place in 1973, but were suppressed by the regime, which forcibly stopped the protests.  The dictatorship collapsed after the <a href="/Invasion_of_Cyprus" title="Invasion of Cyprus">invasion of Cyprus</a>, and handed over power to <a href="/Constantine_Karamanlis" title="Constantine Karamanlis">Constantine Karamanlis</a>.  </p>
<p>There are many political parties in Greece, but only seven are in the Greek parliament.  Until 2015, only two political parties formed governments, the PASOK party (which is <a href="/Social_democrat" title="Social democrat">social democratic</a>) and New Democracy (ND, which is <a href="/Conservatism" title="Conservatism">conservative</a>).  The government ousted in the 2015 election was led by PASOK, DIMAR AND ND. Other parties include the <a href="/Communist" title="Communist">Communist</a> party, the left-wing <a href="/SYRIZA" title="SYRIZA">SYRIZA</a> party, the <a href="/Nationalist" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> party and others. <a href="/SYRIZA" title="SYRIZA">SYRIZA</a>, led by <a href="/Alexis_Tsipras" title="Alexis Tsipras">Alexis Tsipras</a>, won the <a href="/2015" title="2015">2015</a> <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">parliamentary</a> election held on <a href="/January_25" title="January 25">January 25</a> of that year, and entered into a coalition government with the small right-wing party <i>Greek Independents</i>.</p>

<p>
The divisions of Greece are called 'Peripheries'. As of January <a href="/2011" title="2011">2011</a>, there are 13 peripheries in Greece.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Kallikratis"><a href="#_note-Kallikratis" title="">[7]</a></sup> Peripheries are subdivided into 'peripheral units', and previously they were known as 'prefecture', but prefectures were abolished in 2011.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Kallikratis_b"><a href="#_note-Kallikratis" title="">[7]</a></sup> The most populated peripheries in Greece are <a href="/Attica" title="Attica">Attica</a>, where the capital city of Greece, <a href="/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, is, and <a href="/Central_Macedonia" title="Central Macedonia">Central Macedonia</a>, where Greece's second-largest city, <a href="/Thessaloniki" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, is.

<p>Greece is a small country compared to other countries such as the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> , <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, and the United Kingdom. The population of Greece is estimated to be over 10 million. Most of the people in Greece are Greeks, and they form 94% of the population of the country.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ELSTAT"><a href="#_note-ELSTAT" title="">[8]</a></sup> There are also many <a href="/Albania" title="Albania">Albanians</a> in Greece, and they make up 4% of the population.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ELSTAT_b"><a href="#_note-ELSTAT" title="">[8]</a></sup> Other nationalities make up for another 2% of the country.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ELSTAT_c"><a href="#_note-ELSTAT" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Greek government recognizes only one minority in the country, the <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> one in the region of <a href="/Thrace" title="Thrace">Thrace</a>. The dispute between Greece and the <a href="/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> has resulted in the refusal of Greece to acknowledge the existence of a Macedonian minority. The 2001 population <a href="/Census" title="Census">census</a> showed only 747 citizens of the <a href="/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> in Greece.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ELSTAT_d"><a href="#_note-ELSTAT" title="">[8]</a></sup> The <a href="/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a> says that there are a maximum of 300,000 <a href="/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">ethnic Macedonians</a> in Greece, but Greece says that if there is a minority in the country, it would not be more than 30,000 people, in the northern part of the country, near the border with the <a href="/Republic_of_Macedonia" title="Republic of Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>. This is also supported by international organizations.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-GHM"><a href="#_note-GHM" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{Main|Flag of Greece}}
</p>


<p>
The <a href="/Flag_of_Greece" title="Flag of Greece">Greek flag</a> was officially adopted in 1828 as a civil and state ensign (a flag for use only on boats and ships) and as a national flag when flown outside of Greece, for example on embassies. A different flag (white cross on a blue field) was used as a land flag within Greece from 1828 until 1969 and from 1975 to 1978. In 1978 the current flag became <a href="/National_flag" title="National flag">national flag</a> and the older land flag was abolished. </p>
<p>There are many theories about the origin of the color of the flag. One says that the blue represents the color of the sea and the white represents the waves, and others include white for the waves and blue for the sky and white for purity and breakaway from tyranny and blue for Greece. There are nine stripes on the flag, which according to the legend represent the nine syllables in the phrase “Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος’’ which means “freedom or death.’’ The cross stands for Christianity.</p>

<p>
Greece is a <a href="/Capitalist" title="Capitalist">capitalist country</a>, like the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>. Greece has the largest number of trading ships (a 'merchant navy') in the world. Tourism is also a major source of income for Greece. In the 20th century Greece had its own currency but now uses the <a href="/Euro" title="Euro">Euro</a> as most other European Community countries do.  </p>
<p>Greece has adopted some <a href="/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a> policies, such as public healthcare and free education, like many other <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> countries. Greece, however, has not collected enough taxes to pay for them. The <a href="/Pension" title="Pension">pension</a> system is especially expensive. Thousands of Greeks are retired before the age of 55.  Political leaders have decreased the retirement age several times. Currently the average age of retirement is 50 for women and 55 for men. </p>
<p>This is putting Greece in a very difficult situation when the country has accumulated a debt of about €350 billion, or debt by 170 per-cent of the country's total GDP.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Greece also has a trade deficit, meaning that it buys more things than it sells.  The country is cutting costs and asking for loans in order to avoid bankruptcy.</p>

<p>About 16.5 million tourists visit Greece each year.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-CIA_b"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[4]</a></sup> That is more than the country’s entire population.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-CIA_c"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[4]</a></sup> Since there are so many tourist in Greece, it has many international airports.</p>
