A <b>sail</b> is a large piece of <a href="/Cloth" title="Cloth">cloth</a> on the top of some <a href="/Boat" title="Boat">boats</a>. The <a href="/Wind" title="Wind">wind</a> goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>. The piece that the sail is attached to is called a <a href="/Mast" title="Mast">mast</a>. Some boats have many sails, and some have only one. Usually, small boats have only one sail, and bigger boats have more. Boats with sails are called <i>sailing boats</i>. There are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails. </p>
<p>Before people made boats with <a href="/Engine" title="Engine">engines</a> that used <a href="/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> or <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>, sailing boats were an important way to travel across <a href="/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a>. Now they are not so important for transport, but they are still used for <a href="/Recreation" title="Recreation">recreation</a> and <a href="/Competition" title="Competition">competition</a>.</p>

Modern sails can be classified into three main categories: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b>mainsail</b> is a sail located behind the main <a href="/Mast_(sailing)" title="Mast (sailing)">mast</a> of a sailing vessel.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-oct"><a href="#_note-oct" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>A <b>headsail</b> also known as the jib sail, is any sail set forward of the main mast.</li>
<li>A <b>spinnaker</b> or downwind sail (also termed Kite). Special-purpose sails are often a variation of the three main categories.</li>
<li>A <b>staysail</b> is a <a href="/Fore-and-aft_rig" title="Fore-and-aft rig">fore-and-aft rigged</a> sail whose <a href="/Luff_(sail)" title="Luff (sail)">luff</a> can be attached to a <a href="/Forestay" title="Forestay">forestay</a> running from a mast to the  <a href="/Bowsprit" title="Bowsprit">bowsprit</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>High-performance yachts, in particular some catamarans such as the <a href="/International_C-Class_Catamaran" title="International C-Class Catamaran">International C-Class Catamaran</a>, have used or use rigid wing sails, which are said to perform better than traditional soft sails.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  In particular, a rigid wing sail was used by <a href="/Stars_and_Stripes_(yacht)#Catamaran-hull_yachts" title="Stars and Stripes (yacht)">Stars and Stripes</a>, the defender which won the <a href="/1988_America's_Cup" title="1988 America's Cup">1988 America's Cup</a>, and by <a href="/USA_17_(yacht)" title="USA 17 (yacht)">USA-17</a>, the challenger which won the <a href="/2010_America's_Cup" title="2010 America's Cup">2010 America's Cup</a>.</p>
<p>Most modern yachts, including <a href="/Bermuda_rig" title="Bermuda rig">bermuda rig</a>, <a href="/Ketch" title="Ketch">ketch</a> and <a href="/Yawl" title="Yawl">yawl</a> boats, have a sail "inventory" which usually includes more than one of these types of sails. Although the mainsail is “permanently” hoisted while sailing, headsails and spinnakers can be changed depending on the particular weather conditions to allow better handling and speed.</p>
