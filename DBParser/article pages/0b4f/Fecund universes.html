<b>Fecund universes</b> is a <a href="/Multiverse" title="Multiverse">multiverse</a> <a href="/Theory" title="Theory">theory</a> of <a href="/Lee_Smolin" title="Lee Smolin">Lee Smolin</a>.  It relies on <a href="/Models_of_our_universe" title="Models of our universe">models of our universe</a> and <a href="/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a> from <a href="/Astrophysics" title="Astrophysics">astrophysics</a> but is more correctly a theory of <a href="/Cosmology" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a>.</p>
<p>In this theory, collapsing stars, or <a href="/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black holes</a>, are always <a href="/Creating" title="Creating">creating</a> new universes with slightly different <a href="/Laws_of_physics" title="Laws of physics">laws of physics</a>.  Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a <a href="/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutation</a> of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of <a href="/Single-celled_organism" title="Single-celled organism">single-celled organism</a>.  It would <a href="/Reproduce" title="Reproduce">reproduce</a> by "splitting" in some sense.</p>
<p>This theory relies on many <a href="/Models_of_our_universe" title="Models of our universe">models of our universe</a> to model these "mutated" alternative universes, the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or "spun off" by <a href="/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black holes</a>. </p>
<p>No <a href="/Human" title="Human">human</a> can ever be part of any of these "other" universes.  Observations from <a href="/Astrophysics" title="Astrophysics">astrophysics</a> can only say if the black holes exist or are common, and give some idea of how much the <a href="/Laws_of_physics" title="Laws of physics">laws of physics</a> can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes.  </p>
<p>Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see, since they are likely in a very late born universe, by simple probability.  If there are many black holes, that is evidence for his theory, </p>
<p>As this shows, <a href="/Cosmology" title="Cosmology">cosmology</a> has a very different <a href="/Standard_of_evidence" title="Standard of evidence">standard of evidence</a> and <a href="/Burden_of_proof" title="Burden of proof">burden of proof</a> than is required for <a href="/Models_of_our_universe" title="Models of our universe">models of our universe</a> only, which humans (using mathematics) can observe and exchange <a href="/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> on.</p>
<p>It is hard to separate science from <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a> on such questions.  It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one's universe as part of a system like <a href="/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> or like <a href="/Mechanics" title="Mechanics">mechanics</a> - <a href="/Clockwork" title="Clockwork">clockwork</a>.  Smolin's theory is important mostly because it challenges the <a href="/Mechanistic_paradigm" title="Mechanistic paradigm">mechanistic paradigm</a>.  </p>
<p>Even if it is wrong, it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all.  Some compare Smolin's theory to <a href="/Gaia_philosophy" title="Gaia philosophy">Gaia philosophy</a> which combines <a href="/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a>, <a href="/Geology" title="Geology">geology</a> and <a href="/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a> to explain the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, our planet, as a living thing.  If both are right, humans are on a living planet in a living universe.  This idea is very appealing - which does not mean it is really "right".  Some think both are a kind of <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a>.</p></div>
