The typical SUV is a two-box design.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Fogelson"><a href="#_note-Fogelson" title="">[2]</a></sup> Unlike a pickup truck that has an open cargo box the SUV has an enclosed cargo/passenger compartment.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Fogelson_b"><a href="#_note-Fogelson" title="">[2]</a></sup> It has upright <a href="/Seating_capacity" title="Seating capacity">seating</a> for five to seven <a href="/Passenger" title="Passenger">passengers</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Baillie293"><a href="#_note-Baillie293" title="">[3]</a></sup> It has an open interior with no <a href="/Trunk_(automobile)" title="Trunk (automobile)">trunk</a>. It is often built on a <a href="/Pickup_truck" title="Pickup truck">pickup truck</a> <a href="/Chassis" title="Chassis">chassis</a> for towing capacity, and usually has <a href="/Four_wheel_drive" title="Four wheel drive">four wheel drive</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Baillie293_b"><a href="#_note-Baillie293" title="">[3]</a></sup> Only about 15% of SUV owners ever go off road.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Eligul"><a href="#_note-Eligul" title="">[4]</a></sup> According to Jeep Wrangler brand manager Kevin Metz, 60% of <a href="/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a> owners go off road while around 80% of <a href="/Jeep_Wrangler#TJ" title="Jeep Wrangler">Rubicon</a> owners do.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Eligul_b"><a href="#_note-Eligul" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>A similar class of vehicle is the <a href="/Crossover" title="Crossover">crossover</a> (CUV), but it is built on a <a href="/Car" title="Car">car</a> chassis.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-AT"><a href="#_note-AT" title="">[5]</a></sup> Often it uses a <a href="/Unibody" title="Unibody">Unibody</a> chassis instead of the heavier body-on-frame design of SUVs.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-AT_b"><a href="#_note-AT" title="">[5]</a></sup> Crossover vehicles often have <a href="/Four-wheel_drive" title="Four-wheel drive">all-wheel-drive</a> instead of four-wheel drive. Crossovers are usually lighter than SUVs and get better fuel mileage. In general, when referring to an SUV, many include crossovers.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-AT_c"><a href="#_note-AT" title="">[5]</a></sup> However it is incorrect to refer to an SUV on a truck frame as a crossover.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-AT_d"><a href="#_note-AT" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

SUVs come from designs that were originally <a href="/Military" title="Military">military</a>.

There was very little difference between the two and both were made from 1941 to 1945. They were the most widely produced military vehicle during World War II. American soldiers loved their Jeeps and many wanted to buy one when they returned home. Willys began producing a civilian model called the <a href="/Jeep_CJ" title="Jeep CJ">Jeep CJ</a> immediately after the war. These were built from 1946 to 1986.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1948 British Rover Car Company (<a href="/Land_Rover" title="Land Rover">Land Rover</a>) built its first vehicle for rural terrain based on a war surplus Jeep frame.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Slaton285"><a href="#_note-Slaton285" title="">[9]</a></sup> It had an all-<a href="/Aluminum" title="Aluminum">aluminum</a> body and could be <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/repair">repaired</a> in the field. <a href="/British" title="British">British</a> <a href="/Police" title="Police">police</a> forces, the military and other services found them ideal for off-road and as <a href="/Manor_house" title="Manor house">estate</a> vehicles.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Slaton285_b"><a href="#_note-Slaton285" title="">[9]</a></sup> In 1970 the <a href="/Range_Rover" title="Range Rover">Range Rover</a> line was launched and became the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/luxury">luxury</a> SUV vehicles they are today.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>


<p>
In the 1960s Ford introduced the <a href="/Ford_Bronco" title="Ford Bronco">Ford Bronco</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1251"><a href="#_note-Garrett1251" title="">[11]</a></sup> <a href="/International_Harvester" title="International Harvester">International Harvester</a> Company introduced the <a href="/International_Harvester_Scout" title="International Harvester Scout">International Harvester Scout</a> and <a href="/Chevrolet" title="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> brought out the <a href="/Chevrolet_K5_Blazer" title="Chevrolet K5 Blazer">K5 Blazer</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1251_b"><a href="#_note-Garrett1251" title="">[11]</a></sup> Pickup trucks and SUVs combined only sold about 20% of all vehicles in the US in 1965. The rising gas prices and dependence on foreign oil triggered Congress to pass the first <a href="/Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy" title="Corporate Average Fuel Economy">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) standards in 1975. The law required car manufacturers to double fuel economy in the next ten years.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1251_c"><a href="#_note-Garrett1251" title="">[11]</a></sup> But light trucks (including SUVs) were given lower standards by the <a href="/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA).</p>
<p>The 1980s saw smaller lighter SUVs such as the <a href="/Chevrolet_S-10_Blazer" title="Chevrolet S-10 Blazer">Chevrolet S-10 Blazer</a>, the <a href="/Jeep_Cherokee_(XJ)" title="Jeep Cherokee (XJ)">Jeep Cherokee (XJ)</a> and the <a href="/Ford_Bronco_II" title="Ford Bronco II">Ford Bronco II</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1251_d"><a href="#_note-Garrett1251" title="">[11]</a></sup> They were compact SUVs powered by smaller, more fuel efficient engines. The SUVs of the 1980s attracted a different kind of buyer. They wanted to be seen as a rugged, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/masculine">masculine</a>, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outdoors">outdoors</a>-type. But less than 10 percent of users during this period actually drove off road.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1251_e"><a href="#_note-Garrett1251" title="">[11]</a></sup> By the mid-1980s concerns were rising over SUV safety. The <a href="/CBS_News" title="CBS News">CBS News</a> program <a href="/60_Minutes" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a> showed footage of a Jeep CJ rolling over. Other tests showed the Ford Bronco II could tip onto two wheels in turns as slow as {{convert|20|mph}}.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1251_f"><a href="#_note-Garrett1251" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Safety concerns continued through the 1990s. In May 2000, the (NHTSA) contacted <a href="/Ford_Motor_Company" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford</a> and <a href="/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company" title="Firestone Tire and Rubber Company">Firestone</a>. There was a high incidence of <a href="/Tire" title="Tire">tire</a> failure on <a href="/Ford_Explorer" title="Ford Explorer">Ford Explorers</a>, <a href="/Mercury_Mountaineer" title="Mercury Mountaineer">Mercury Mountaineers</a>, and <a href="/Mazda_Navajo" title="Mazda Navajo">Mazda Navajos</a> fitted with Firestone tires. There were Accidents involving Firestone-equipped Explorers resulting in at least 174 deaths and more than 700 injuries.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Ford blamed Firestone and Firestone blamed Ford. In the end, Firestone's reputation suffered more than Ford's.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>But by 2005 gas prices had risen to $3 per gallon.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1253"><a href="#_note-Garrett1253" title="">[14]</a></sup> It was gas prices and not safety that caused the manufacturers to make significant changes. The first CUV or crossover vehicle, the <a href="/Toyota_RAV4" title="Toyota RAV4">Toyota RAV4</a> had been sold in the US since 1996. But with higher gas prices CUVs became more popular. They were smaller, lighter and could share engines and chassis designs with existing models. The <a href="/Lexus_RX" title="Lexus RX">Lexus RX</a> and the <a href="/BMW_X5" title="BMW X5">BMW X5</a> followed along with other models.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1253_b"><a href="#_note-Garrett1253" title="">[14]</a></sup> In 2006 Ford changed to a unibody CUV chassis for its <a href="/Ford_Explorer" title="Ford Explorer">Ford Explorer</a> vehicle. By then CUV sales made up half of the overall SUV market.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1253_c"><a href="#_note-Garrett1253" title="">[14]</a></sup> By 2012 CUV sales were higher than SUV sales.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Garrett1253_d"><a href="#_note-Garrett1253" title="">[14]</a></sup> While CUVs are not designed for off road use like an SUV, they are still very popular.

There are many reasons why SUVs have become popular. One reason is the comfort of their large cabins. Many models can carry almost as much as a minivan. Another reason is the driver still sits higher than other cars and SUVs with truck frames can be among the heavier vehicles on the highway. Their size gives them an image of safety.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-20"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Men aren't the only targets of SUV and CUV ads.
