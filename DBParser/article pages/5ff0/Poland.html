<p>The word "Poland" was written officially for the first time in 966. In 1569, Poland formed a strong union with Lithuania called the <a href="/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. At some point in its history, it was the largest <a href="/State" title="State">state</a> in Europe and became very influential. Much of the territory that now makes up Central European states used to belong to that Commonwealth. Eventually, after a slow decline, the Commonwealth <a href="/Partitions_of_Poland" title="Partitions of Poland">collapsed</a> in 1795. Poland regained its <a href="/Independence" title="Independence">independence</a> in 1918 after <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. In 1921, Poland defeated Soviet Russia in the <a href="/Polish-Soviet_War" title="Polish-Soviet War">Polish-Soviet War</a> that started in 1919.</p>
<p>However, Poland lost independence again not long after the beginning of <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, after suffering a defeat by both the <a href="/USSR" title="USSR">USSR</a> and <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. Although the government collapsed, the Polish people fought on by forming the largest and most effective resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. It is most notable for disrupting German supply lines to the Eastern Front of WWII, providing military intelligence to the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a>, and for saving more <a href="/Jews" title="Jews">Jewish</a> lives in the <a href="/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> than any other <a href="/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> organization or government. After the war, Poland regained "independence" and became a <a href="/People's_Republic_of_Poland" title="People's Republic of Poland">communist country</a> within the <a href="/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>.

<p>{{main|History of Poland}}
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Before_Piasts">Before Piasts</span></h3>
<p>The first sign of humans in Polish lands was 500,000 years ago. The <a href="/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> started around 2400-2300 <a href="/BC" title="BC">BC</a>. The <a href="/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> started around 750-700 <a href="/BC" title="BC">BC</a>. At that time the Polish lands were under the influence of the <a href="/Lusatian_culture" title="Lusatian culture">Lusatian culture</a>. About 400 BC <a href="/Celts" title="Celts">Celtic</a> and <a href="/Germanic_people" title="Germanic people">Germanic</a> tribes lived there. Those people had trade contacts with the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, <a href="/Slavs" title="Slavs">Slavs</a> came to Polish lands. Some of those Slavs, now commonly referred to as Western Slavs (though in reality a diverse group of tribes with shared ethnic and cultural features), stayed there and started to create new nations. The most powerful tribe was called the <a href="/Polans" title="Polans">Polans</a>, who united all of the other Slavic tribes living there, and this is where the name "Poland" comes from.</p>

<p>
Poland began to form into a country around the middle of the <a href="/10th_century" title="10th century">10th century</a> in the <a href="/Piast_dynasty" title="Piast dynasty">Piast dynasty</a>. In 966, Prince <a href="/Mieszko_I" title="Mieszko I">Mieszko I</a> became a <a href="/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a>, and so the Polish people also became Christians. The next king was <a href="/Boles%C5%82aw_I_of_Poland" title="Bolesław I of Poland">Bolesław I of Poland</a> (called Bolesław the Brave). He conquered many lands and he became the first King of Poland. <a href="/Casimir_I_of_Poland" title="Casimir I of Poland">Casimir I of Poland</a> changed the Polish capital from <a href="/Gniezno" title="Gniezno">Gniezno</a> to <a href="/Krak%C3%B3w" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>. In the 12th century Poland broke into some smaller <a href="/States" title="States">states</a> after the death of King <a href="/Boles%C5%82aw_III_Wrymouth" title="Bolesław III Wrymouth">Bolesław III Wrymouth</a> in <a href="/1138" title="1138">1138</a> because of his <a href="/Will_(law)" title="Will (law)">will</a>. Those states were later attacked by <a href="/Mongol" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> armies in <a href="/1241" title="1241">1241</a>, which slowed down the unification of the small states into the big country of Poland. This happened eighty years later, in <a href="/1320" title="1320">1320</a>, when <a href="/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_I_of_Poland" title="Władysław I of Poland">Władysław I</a> became the King of the United Poland. His son <a href="/Casimir_III" title="Casimir III">Casimir III</a> the Great reformed the Polish economy, built new castles and won the war against the <a href="/Ruthenian_Dukedom" title="Ruthenian Dukedom">Ruthenian Dukedom</a>. Many people <a href="/Emigration" title="Emigration">emigrated</a> to Poland, becoming a haven for emigrants . A large number of <a href="/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> people also moved into Poland during that time. The <a href="/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>, which affected many parts of <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> from <a href="/1347" title="1347">1347</a> to <a href="/1351" title="1351">1351</a>, did not come to Poland.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-REF03"><a href="#_note-REF03" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the death of the last Piast on the Polish throne, <a href="/Casimir_III_of_Poland" title="Casimir III of Poland">Casimir III</a>, <a href="/Louis_I_of_Hungary" title="Louis I of Hungary">Louis I of Hungary</a> and his daughter <a href="/Jadwiga_of_Poland" title="Jadwiga of Poland">Jadwiga of Poland</a> began their rule. She married the <a href="/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuanian</a> prince <a href="/Jogaila" title="Jogaila">Jogaila</a>. Their marriage started a new dynasty in Poland: the <a href="/Jagiellon_dynasty" title="Jagiellon dynasty">Jagiellon dynasty</a>. Under the <a href="/Jagiellon_dynasty" title="Jagiellon dynasty">Jagiellon dynasty</a>, Poland made an alliance with its neighbor <a href="/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>.</p>

<p>
In the 17th century <a href="/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> attacked almost all of Poland (this was called “the Deluge”). Many wars against the <a href="/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/Cossacks" title="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>, <a href="/Transylvania" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> and <a href="/Brandenburg-Prussia" title="Brandenburg-Prussia">Brandenburg-Prussia</a> ended in <a href="/1699" title="1699">1699</a>. For the next 80 years, the government and the nation were weak, making Poland dependent on Russia. Russian <a href="/Tsars" title="Tsars">tsars</a> took advantage of this by offering money to dishonest members of the Polish <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a>, who would block new ideas and solutions. <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and <a href="/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a> broke Poland into three pieces in <a href="/1772" title="1772">1772</a>, <a href="/1793" title="1793">1793</a> and <a href="/1795" title="1795">1795</a>, which dissolved the country. Before the second split, a <a href="/Constitution" title="Constitution">Constitution</a> called "<a href="/The_Constitution_of_3_May" title="The Constitution of 3 May">The Constitution of 3 May</a>" was made in 1791. The Polish people did not like the new kings, and often rebelled (two big <a href="/Rebellion" title="Rebellion">rebellions</a> in 1830<sup class="reference" id="_ref-REF03_b"><a href="#_note-REF03" title="">[11]</a></sup> and 1863{{fact|date=April 2009}}).
<a href="/Napoleon" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> made another Polish state, “the <a href="/Duchy_of_Warsaw" title="Duchy of Warsaw">Duchy of Warsaw</a>”, but after the <a href="/Napoleonic_wars" title="Napoleonic wars">Napoleonic wars</a>, Poland was split again by the countries at the <a href="/Congress_of_Vienna" title="Congress of Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>.

During <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> all the <a href="/Allies_of_World_War_I" title="Allies of World War I">Allies</a> agreed to save Poland.

Poland was split up into two pieces, one half owned by Nazi Germany, the other by the Soviet Union.

Most of these deaths were part of the <a href="/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, in which 6 million Jews were killed. At the war's end, Poland's borders were moved west, pushing the eastern border to the <a href="/Curzon_line" title="Curzon line">Curzon line</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The western border was moved to the <a href="/Oder-Neisse_line" title="Oder-Neisse line">Oder-Neisse line</a>. The new Poland became 20% smaller by 77,500 square kilometers (29,900 sq mi). The shift forced millions of Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews to move. </p>

<p>After these events Poland gradually became a <a href="/Communism" title="Communism">communist</a> country. It was supposedly an independent country.  But in reality the new government was appointed by <a href="/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>.  It was also under the control of the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. The country was then renamed the <a href="/People's_Republic_of_Poland" title="People's Republic of Poland">People's Republic of Poland</a>. There are many Poles in the neighboring countries <a href="/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, and Lithuania (these three countries were part of the Soviet Union until 1991), as well as in other countries. The most Poles outside of Poland are in the United States, especially in <a href="/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Germany and the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> are also home to a large Polish diaspora.

<p>The Polish Baltic coast is mostly smooth but has natural <a href="/Harbor" title="Harbor">harbors</a> in the <a href="/Tricity" title="Tricity">Gdańsk-Gdynia</a> region and <a href="/Szczecin" title="Szczecin">Szczecin</a> in the far northwest. This coast has several <a href="/Spit" title="Spit">spits</a>, <a href="/Dune" title="Dune">dunes</a> and coastal lakes.

<p>The northeastern region is densely wooded, sparsely populated and lacks agricultural and industrial resources. The geographical region has four hilly <a href="/District" title="District">districts</a> of <a href="/Moraine" title="Moraine">moraines</a> and lakes created by moraines.

<p>Poland is made of sixteen <a href="/Region" title="Region">regions</a> known as <a href="/Voivodeship" title="Voivodeship">voivodeships</a> (<i>województwa</i>, singular - <i>województwo</i>). They are basically created from the country's historical regions, whereas those of the past two decades (till <a href="/1998" title="1998">1998</a>) had been focused on and named for separate cities.

In the past, Poland was inhabited by people from different nations and of different religions (mainly <a href="/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Catholics</a>, <a href="/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Orthodox</a> and <a href="/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>). This changed after <a href="/1939" title="1939">1939</a>, because of the <a href="/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> <a href="/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> which killed many Polish Jews. After <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the country was changed into a <a href="/Communism" title="Communism">communist</a> country, by the <a href="/Warsaw_Pact" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> which included most central European countries and Russia <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>.</p>
<p>Today 38,038,000 people live in Poland (2011). In 2002 96.74% of the population call themselves Polish, while 471,500 people (1.23%) claimed another nationality. 774,900 people (2.03%) did not declare any nationality. Nationalities, or <a href="/Ethnicity" title="Ethnicity">ethnic groups</a> in Poland are <a href="/Silesians" title="Silesians">Silesians</a>, <a href="/Germans" title="Germans">Germans</a> (most in the former <a href="/Opole_Voivodeship" title="Opole Voivodeship">Opole Voivodeship</a>), <a href="/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukrainians</a>, <a href="/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuanians</a>, <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russians</a>, <a href="/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</a> and <a href="/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarusians</a>.

It is also the <a href="/Official_language" title="Official language">official language</a> of Poland. <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a> are the most common second languages studied and spoken.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Poland's population has gone down because of an increase in <a href="/Emigrate" title="Emigrate">emigration</a> and a sharp drop in the birth rate. In <a href="/2006" title="2006">2006</a>, the census office estimated the total population of Poland at 38,536,869, a very small rise on the 2002 figure of 38,230,080. Since Poland's accession to the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>, a large number of Polish people have moved to work in Western European countries like the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>. Some organizations state people have left because of high <a href="/Unemployment" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> (10.5%) and better opportunities for work somewhere else. In April 2007, the Polish population of the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> had risen to about 300,000 people and estimates predict about 65,000 Polish people living in the <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>. However, in recent years strong growth of Polish economy and increasing value of Polish currency (PLN) makes many Polish immigrants to go back home. In 2007, the number of people leaving the country was lower than people who are coming back. Poland became an attractive place to work for people from other countries (mainly Ukraine).</p>
<p>A Polish minority is still present in neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, as well as in other countries. The largest number of ethnic Poles outside of the country can be found in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
