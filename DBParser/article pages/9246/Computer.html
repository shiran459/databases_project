A <b>computer</b> is a <a href="/Machine" title="Machine">machine</a> (mostly electronic) that is able to take information (<a href="/Information" title="Information">input</a>), and process it to make new information (<a href="/Output" title="Output">output</a>). Computers have existed for much of human <a href="/History" title="History">history</a>.  Examples of early computers are the <a href="/Astrolabe" title="Astrolabe">astrolabe</a> and the <a href="/Abacus" title="Abacus">abacus</a>. There are four main processing steps in a computer, and they are: <a href="/Input_device" title="Input device">inputting</a>, <a href="/Computer_memory" title="Computer memory">storage</a>, <a href="/Output_device" title="Output device">outputting</a> and processing.</p>
<p>Modern computers are very different from early computers. They can do billions of calculations per second. Most people have used a <a href="/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a> in their home or at work. Computers do many different jobs where <a href="/Automaton" title="Automaton">automation</a> is useful.  Some examples are controlling <a href="/Traffic_light" title="Traffic light">traffic lights</a>, <a href="/Vehicle" title="Vehicle">vehicle</a> computers, security systems, <a href="/Washing_machine" title="Washing machine">washing machines</a> and digital televisions.</p>
<p>A computer user can control it by a <a href="/User_interface" title="User interface">user interface</a>.  <a href="/Input_device" title="Input device">Input devices</a> include <a href="/Keyboard_(computer)" title="Keyboard (computer)">keyboard</a>, <a href="/Computer_mouse" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a>, buttons, and <a href="/Touch_screen" title="Touch screen">touch screen</a>s. Some very sophisticated computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves.</p>
<p>Computers can be designed to do almost anything with information. Computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans. They are also in homes, where they are used for things such as listening to music, reading the <a href="/News" title="News">news</a> and writing.</p>
<p>Modern computers are electronic <a href="/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">computer hardware</a>. They do mathematical <a href="/Arithmetic" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> very quickly but computers do not really "think".   They only follow the instructions in their software programs. The <a href="/Software" title="Software">software</a> uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions, and gives useful output.</p>
<p>Computer programs are designed or written by computer <a href="/Programmer" title="Programmer">programmers</a>. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called <a href="/Machine_code" title="Machine code">machine code</a>. Most programs are written using a <a href="/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming language</a> like <a href="/C%2B%2B" title="C++">C++</a>, <a href="/Java_programming_language" title="Java programming language">Java</a>, and <a href="/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a>. These programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day. The comput<a href="/Compiler" title="Compiler">er</a> translates the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) that the computer will understand and do what is needed.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h3>
<p>A computer is a programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations. Mainframes, desktop and laptop computers, tablets and smartphones are some of the different types of computers. An electronic <a href="/Machine" title="Machine">machine</a> which helps in solving problems quickly and easily. It solves problems according to instructions given to it by the computer user called programs or software. It is a digital machine(that uses binary digits) used in all fields.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Automation">Automation</span></h3>
<p>Most humans have a problem with math. To show this, try doing 584 × 3,220 in your head.  It is hard to remember all the steps!  People made tools to help them remember where they were in a maths problem. The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again. A <a href="/Cashier" title="Cashier">cashier</a> had to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper. That took a lot of time and made mistakes. So, people made <a href="/Calculator" title="Calculator">calculators</a> that did those same things over and over. This part of computer history is called the "history of automated calculation," which is a fancy phrase for "the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same maths problem over and over without making mistakes."</p>
<p>The <a href="/Abacus" title="Abacus">abacus</a>, the <a href="/Slide_rule" title="Slide rule">slide rule</a>,  the <a href="/Astrolabe" title="Astrolabe">astrolabe</a> and the <a href="/Antikythera_mechanism" title="Antikythera mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a> (which dates from about 150-100 BC) are examples of automated calculation machines.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Programming">Programming</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Computer programming}}
People did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again. For example, a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again. Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. They wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music. This part of computer history is called the "history of programmable machines" which is a fancy phrase for "The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language."</p>
<p>One of the first examples of this was built by <a href="/Hero_of_Alexandria" title="Hero of Alexandria">Hero of Alexandria</a> (c. 10–70 AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Historians disagree on which early machines are "computers". Many say the "castle clock", an <a href="/Astronomical_clock" title="Astronomical clock">astronomical clock</a> invented by <a href="/Al-Jazari" title="Al-Jazari">Al-Jazari</a> in 1206, is the first known <a href="/Computer_programming" title="Computer programming">programmable</a> <a href="/Analog_computer" title="Analog computer">analog computer</a>. Others say the first computer was made by <a href="/Charles_Babbage" title="Charles Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ancient_Discoveries"><a href="#_note-Ancient_Discoveries" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/Al_-_Jazari" title="Al - Jazari">Al - Jazari</a>'s showed the <a href="/Zodiac" title="Zodiac">zodiac</a>, the <a href="/Heliocentric_orbit" title="Heliocentric orbit">solar</a> and <a href="/Lunar_orbit" title="Lunar orbit">lunar orbits</a>, a <a href="/Lunar_phase" title="Lunar phase">crescent moon</a>-shaped <a href="/Pointer_(computing)" title="Pointer (computing)">pointer</a> travelling across a gateway that made some <a href="/Door" title="Door">doors</a> to open every <a href="/Hour" title="Hour">hour</a>,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Hill2"><a href="#_note-Hill2" title="">[4]</a></sup> and five <a href="/Robot" title="Robot">robotic</a> musicians who play music when <a href="/Lever" title="Lever">levers</a> hit them. The length of <a href="/Day" title="Day">day</a> and <a href="/Night" title="Night">night</a> could be changed (AKA re-programmed) every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ancient_Discoveries_b"><a href="#_note-Ancient_Discoveries" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/Ada_Lovelace" title="Ada Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> is considered to be the first <a href="/Programmer" title="Programmer">programmer</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Annals_of_the_History_of_Computing"><a href="#_note-Annals_of_the_History_of_Computing" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Lovelace_Google"><a href="#_note-Lovelace_Google" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Computing_Era">The Computing Era</span></h3>

<p>At the end of the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, people in Europe thought math and <a href="/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a> were more important. In 1623, <a href="/Wilhelm_Schickard" title="Wilhelm Schickard">Wilhelm Schickard</a> made a mechanical calculator.  Other Europeans made more calculators after him.  They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris.  Because of this, we say they were not programmable. Now engineers use computers to design and plan.</p>
<p>In 1801, <a href="/Joseph_Marie_Jacquard" title="Joseph Marie Jacquard">Joseph Marie Jacquard</a> used <a href="/Punch_card" title="Punch card">punched paper cards</a> to tell his <a href="/Loom" title="Loom">textile loom</a> what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted.  This means the loom was programmable.</p>
<p><a href="/Charles_Babbage" title="Charles Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate.   He called it "The Analytical Engine".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.</p>
<p>As time went on, computers were used more.  People get bored easily doing the same thing over and over.  Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again.  The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that.  It was expensive, and reports took a long time.  Then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work.  <a href="/Herman_Hollerith" title="Herman Hollerith">Herman Hollerith</a> invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected.  The <a href="/Computing_Tabulating_Recording_Corporation" title="Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation">Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation</a> (which later became <a href="/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>) made his machines.  They <a href="/Lease" title="Lease">leased</a> the machines instead of selling them.  Makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them, and CTR's tech support was especially good.</p>
<p>Because of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Analog_and_Digital_Computers">Analog and Digital Computers</span></h3>

<p>In the first half of the 20th century, <a href="/Scientist" title="Scientist">scientist</a>s started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together.  For example, if they had to launch a <a href="/Rocket_ship" title="Rocket ship">rocket ship</a>, they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right. So they put together computers. These <a href="/Analog_computer" title="Analog computer">analog computer</a>s used <a href="/Analog_signal" title="Analog signal">analog</a> circuits, which made them very hard to program. In the 1930s, they invented <a href="/Digital" title="Digital">digital</a> computers, and soon made them easier to program.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="High-scale_computers">High-scale computers</span></h3>

<p>Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s.  Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them.  Here are a few of the computers they built:</p>
<p>{{Early computer characteristics}}</p>


<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Konrad_Zuse" title="Konrad Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a>'s <a href="/Electromechanics" title="Electromechanics">electromechanical</a> "Z machines". The <a href="/Z3_(computer)" title="Z3 (computer)">Z3</a> (1941) was the first working machine that used <a href="/Binary_numeral_system" title="Binary numeral system">binary</a> arithmetic.  Binary arithmetic means using "Yes" and "No." to add numbers together.  You could also program it.  In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be <a href="/Turing_complete" title="Turing complete">Turing complete</a>.  Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer.  It is the world's first modern computer.</li>
<li>The non-programmable <a href="/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_Computer" title="Atanasoff–Berry Computer">Atanasoff–Berry Computer</a> (1941) which used vacuum tubes to store "yes" and "no" answers, and <a href="/Regenerative_capacitor_memory" title="Regenerative capacitor memory">regenerative capacitor memory</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="/Harvard_Mark_I" title="Harvard Mark I">Harvard Mark I</a> (1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.</li>
<li>The U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory <a href="/ENIAC" title="ENIAC">ENIAC</a> (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose <a href="/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronic</a> computer (since <a href="/Konrad_Zuse" title="Konrad Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a>'s <a href="/Z3_(computer)" title="Z3 (computer)">Z3</a> of 1941 used <a href="/Electromagnets" title="Electromagnets">electromagnets</a> instead of <a href="/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronics</a>). At first, however, the only way to reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as "stored program architecture" or <a href="/Von_Neumann_architecture" title="Von Neumann architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>. <a href="/John_von_Neumann" title="John von Neumann">John von Neumann</a> talked about this design in the paper <i>First Draft of a Report on the <a href="/EDVAC" title="EDVAC">EDVAC</a></i>, distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time.  The first of these was completed in <a href="/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. The first to be demonstrated working was the <a href="/University_of_Manchester" title="University of Manchester">Manchester</a> Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM or "Baby"), while the <a href="/EDSAC" title="EDSAC">EDSAC</a>, completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—<a href="/EDVAC" title="EDVAC">EDVAC</a>—was completed but was not ready for two years.</p>
<p>Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture. It has become the main <a href="/Concept" title="Concept">concept</a> which defines a modern computer. The technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.</p>


<p>In the 1950s computers were built out of mostly <a href="/Vacuum_tube" title="Vacuum tube">vacuum tubes</a>.  <a href="/Transistors" title="Transistors">Transistors</a> replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper.   They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on <a href="/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuits</a>. <a href="/Microprocessor" title="Microprocessor">Microprocessors</a>, such as the <a href="/Intel_4004" title="Intel 4004">Intel 4004</a> made computers smaller, cheaper, faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, <a href="/Microcontroller" title="Microcontroller">microcontrollers</a> became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like <a href="/Washing_machine" title="Washing machine">washing machines</a>. The 1980s also saw <a href="/Home_computer" title="Home computer">home computers</a> and <a href="/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a>. With the evolution of the <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>, personal computers are becoming as common as the <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a> and the <a href="/Telephone" title="Telephone">telephone</a> in the household.</p>
<p>In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) "multimedia computers" and after the launch of the Apple <a href="/IPhone" title="IPhone">iPhone</a> in 2007, many are now starting to add the <a href="/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphone</a> category among "real" computers.  In 2008, if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, was no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather <a href="/Nokia" title="Nokia">Nokia</a>.{{fact|date=December 2008}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_computers">Kinds of computers</span></h2>
<p>There are many types of computers:
</p>

<li><a href="/Embedded_system" title="Embedded system">embedded system</a></li>
</ol>

<p>A "desktop computer" is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer).  Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called "desktop computers." "<a href="/Laptop" title="Laptop">Laptop</a> computers" are computers small enough to fit on your lap.  This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games.</p>
<p>There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use.  These are called "Mainframes," and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this:  the personal computer is like your skin:  you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world.  A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.</p>
<p>An embedded computer, also called <a href="/Embedded_system" title="Embedded system">embedded system</a> is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well.  For example, an <a href="/Alarm_clock" title="Alarm clock">alarm clock</a> is an embedded computer:  it tells the time.  Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris.  Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed, because you cannot install more programs on your clock.  Some <a href="/Mobile_phone" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>, <a href="/Automatic_teller_machine" title="Automatic teller machine">automatic teller machines</a>, <a href="/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave ovens</a>, <a href="/CD_player" title="CD player">CD players</a> and <a href="/Car" title="Car">cars</a> are operated by embedded computers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="All-in-one_PC">All-in-one PC</span></h3>
<p>All-in-one computers are <a href="/PC" title="PC">desktop computers</a> that have all of the computer's inner mechanisms in the same case as the <a href="/Computer_monitor" title="Computer monitor">monitor</a>. <a href="/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a> has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers, such as the <a href="/Macintosh_128K" title="Macintosh 128K">original Macintosh</a> of the mid-1980s and the <a href="/IMac" title="IMac">iMac</a> of the late 1990s and 2000s.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Working_methods">Working methods</span></h2>
<p>Computers store data and the instructions as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as <a href="/Binary" title="Binary">binary</a> <a href="/Symbol" title="Symbol">symbols</a> (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a <a href="/Bit" title="Bit">bit</a>, which comes from the words binary <a href="/Numerical_digit" title="Numerical digit">digit</a>. Computers can use many bits together to represent <a href="/Instruction_(computer_science)" title="Instruction (computer science)">instructions</a> and the data that these instructions use. A list of instructions is called a <a href="/Computer_program" title="Computer program">program</a> and is stored on the computer's <a href="/Hard_disk" title="Hard disk">hard disk</a>. Computers work through the program by using a <a href="/Central_processing_unit" title="Central processing unit">central processing unit</a>, and they use fast memory called <a href="/RAM" title="RAM">RAM</a> as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this. When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later, it uses the <a href="/Hard_disk" title="Hard disk">hard disk</a> because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off.</p>
<p>An <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results.  Millions of computers may be using the same <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a>, while each computer can have its own <a href="/Application_program" title="Application program">application programs</a> to do what its user needs.  Using the same <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating systems</a> makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things.  A user who needs to use a computer for something different, can learn how to use a new application program.  Some <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating systems</a> can have simple command lines or a fully user-frendly <a href="/GUI" title="GUI">GUI</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Internet">The Internet</span></h2>
<p>One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with <a href="/Communication" title="Communication">communication</a>. Communication is how people share <a href="/Information" title="Information">information</a>. Computers have helped people move forward in <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a>, <a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="/Business" title="Business">business</a>, and <a href="/Learning" title="Learning">learning</a>, because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/people">people</a> communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> is the thing that lets <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/people">people</a> communicate between their computers.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Computers_and_waste">Computers and waste</span></h2>
<p>A computer is now almost always an <a href="/Electronic_device" title="Electronic device">electronic device</a>.  It usually contains materials that will become <a href="/Electronic_waste" title="Electronic waste">electronic waste</a> when discarded  When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its <a href="/Waste_management" title="Waste management">waste management</a> must also be paid for.  This is called <a href="/Product_stewardship" title="Product stewardship">product stewardship</a>.</p>
<p>Computers can become <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obsolete">obsolete</a> quickly, depending on what programs the user runs.  Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so <a href="/Computer_recycling" title="Computer recycling">computer recycling</a> happens a lot.  Many projects try to send working computers to <a href="/Developing_nation" title="Developing nation">developing nations</a> so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. Some computer parts, such as <a href="/Hard_drive" title="Hard drive">hard drives</a>, can break easily. When these parts end up in the <a href="/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfill</a>, they can put <a href="/Poison" title="Poison">poisonous</a> chemicals like <a href="/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a> into the ground water. Hard drives can also contain secret information like <a href="/Credit_card" title="Credit card">credit card</a> numbers.  If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away, an <a href="/Identity_theft" title="Identity theft">identity thief</a> can get the information from the hard drive, even if the drive doesn't work, and use it to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.</p>

<p>Computers come in different forms, but most of them have a common design.
</p>
<ul>
<li>All computers have a <a href="/CPU" title="CPU">CPU</a>.</li>
<li>All computers have some kind of <a href="/Data_bus" title="Data bus">data bus</a> which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.</li>
<li>All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips (<a href="/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">integrated circuits</a>) which can hold information.</li>
<li>Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.</li>
<li>Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other <a href="/Peripheral_equipment" title="Peripheral equipment">peripheral devices</a> connected.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the <a href="/CPU" title="CPU">CPU</a> is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the <a href="/Nerves" title="Nerves">nerves</a> that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides <a href="/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> to the entire computer. The various drives (<a href="/Compact_disc" title="Compact disc">CD</a> drive,  <a href="/Floppy_drive" title="Floppy drive">floppy drive</a>, and on many newer computers, <a href="/USB_flash_drive" title="USB flash drive">USB flash drive</a>) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The <a href="/Hard_drive" title="Hard drive">hard drive</a> is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a <a href="/Sound_card" title="Sound card">sound card</a> or another method of making sound, which is like <a href="/Vocal_cords" title="Vocal cords">vocal cords</a>, or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are <a href="/Computer_speaker" title="Computer speaker">speakers</a>, which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a <a href="/Graphics_card" title="Graphics card">graphics card</a>, which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.</p>
