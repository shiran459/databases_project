<p><b>English</b>  is a <a href="/West_Germanic_languages" title="West Germanic languages">West Germanic language</a> that was first spoken in <a href="/Anglo-Saxon" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> England in the early <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. It is now the third most widely used language in the world, behind <a href="/Mandarin_Chinese" title="Mandarin Chinese">Mandarin</a> and <a href="/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It is spoken in many <a href="/Country" title="Country">countries</a> around the world. <a href="/Anglosphere" title="Anglosphere">Anglosphere</a> countries includes the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and a number of <a href="/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> nations. There are about 375 million <a href="/Native" title="Native">native</a> <a href="/Speech" title="Speech">speakers</a> (people who use English as their first language),<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> which is the largest after <a href="/Mandarin_Chinese" title="Mandarin Chinese">Mandarin</a> and <a href="/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>. About 220 million more people use it as their second language. It is often used in work and travel, and there are at least a <a href="/Billion" title="Billion">billion</a> people who are learning it. This makes English the second most spoken language, and the most international language in the world. </p>
<p>English has changed and developed over time.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The most obvious changes are the many words taken from <a href="/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a> and <a href="/French_language" title="French language">French</a>. <a href="/English_grammar" title="English grammar">English grammar</a> has also become very different from other Germanic languages, without becoming much like Romance languages. Because nearly 60% of the vocabulary comes from <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>, English is sometimes called the most Latin of the Germanic languages, and is often mistaken for being a <a href="/Romance_languages" title="Romance languages">Romance language</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>As its name suggests, the English language began in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germanic</a> tribes (<a href="/Saxons" title="Saxons">Saxons</a>, <a href="/Anglo-Saxon" title="Anglo-Saxon">Angles</a>, and <a href="/Jutes" title="Jutes">Jutes</a>) came to Britain from around 449 <a href="/AD" title="AD">AD</a>. They made their home in the south and east of the island, pushing out the <a href="/Britons_(Celtic_people)" title="Britons (Celtic people)">Celtic Britons</a> who were there before them, or making them speak the English language instead of the old <a href="/Celtic_languages" title="Celtic languages">Celtic languages</a>. Some people still speak <a href="/Celtic_languages" title="Celtic languages">Celtic languages</a> today, in <a href="/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> (<a href="/Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a>) and elsewhere. <a href="/Scottish_Gaelic" title="Scottish Gaelic">Gaelic</a> is the Scottish Celtic language, still spoken by some in the <a href="/Highlands_and_Islands" title="Highlands and Islands">Highlands and Islands</a>. "<a href="/Scots" title="Scots">Scots</a>" is a dialect of English (although some call it a separate language). <a href="/Irish_Gaelic" title="Irish Gaelic">Irish Gaelic</a> is spoken by very few people today.</p>
<p>The Germanic <a href="/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialects</a> of these different tribes became what is now called <a href="/Old_English_language" title="Old English language">Old English</a>. The word "English" comes from the name of the Angles: <i>Englas</i>. Old English did not sound or look much like the English spoken today. If English speakers today were to hear or read a passage in Old English, they would understand just a few words.</p>
<p>The closest language to English that is still used today is <a href="/Frisian" title="Frisian">Frisian</a>, spoken by about 500,000 people living in the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>. Although it is a lot like English (and was even closer before Old English changed to <a href="/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>), speakers of the two languages would not be able to understand each other. That is why people suggest that the closest <i>major</i> language to English is <a href="/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> which is spoken in the Netherlands and nearby <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a> is spoken in Germany, <a href="/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and some German words are also a lot like English. All these languages belong to the same West Germanic family as English.</p>
<p>Many other people came to England later at different times, speaking different languages, and these languages added more words to make today's English. For example, around 800 AD, many <a href="/Denmark" title="Denmark">Danish</a> and <a href="/Norse" title="Norse">Norse</a> <a href="/Pirate" title="Pirate">pirates</a>, also called <a href="/Vikings" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>, came to the country, established <a href="/Danelaw" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>. So, English got many Norse <a href="/Loanword" title="Loanword">loanword</a>s. Their languages were <a href="/Germanic_languages" title="Germanic languages">Germanic languages</a>, like Old English, but are a little different. They are called the <a href="/North_Germanic_languages" title="North Germanic languages">North Germanic languages</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="/William_the_Conqueror" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> took over England in 1066 AD, he brought his <a href="/Noble" title="Noble">nobles</a>, who spoke <a href="/Norman_language" title="Norman language">Norman</a>, a language closely related to <a href="/French_language" title="French language">French</a>. The language changed greatly because it was mostly being spoken instead of written for about 300 years (official written documents were in Norman French). English borrowed many words from Norman at that time, and also began to drop the old <a href="/Grammatical_case" title="Grammatical case">word endings</a>. English of this time is called <a href="/Middle_English" title="Middle English">Middle English</a>. <a href="/Geoffrey_Chaucer" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> is a well known writer of Middle English. After more sound changes, Middle English became Modern English.</p>
<p>English continued to take new words from other languages, for example mainly from French (around 30% to 40% of its words), but also <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, <a href="/Hindi" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> and <a href="/Urdu" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>, <a href="/Japanese_language" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>, <a href="/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>, <a href="/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, <a href="/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>, etc. Because scientists from different countries needed to talk to one another, they chose names for scientific things in the languages they all knew: <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> and <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>. Those words came to English also, for example, <i>photography</i> ("photo-" means "light" "and "-graph " means "picture" or "writing", in Greek.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> A photograph is a picture made using light), or <i>telephone</i>. So, English is made of Old English, Danish, Norse, and French, and has been changed by Latin, Greek, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Dutch and Spanish, and some words from other languages. </p>
<p><a href="/English_grammar" title="English grammar">English grammar</a> has also changed, becoming simpler and less Germanic. The classic example is the loss of <a href="/Case_(grammar)" title="Case (grammar)">case</a> in grammar. Grammatical case shows the role of a noun, adjective or pronoun in a sentence. In Latin (and other Indo-European languages) this is done by adding <a href="/Suffix" title="Suffix">suffixes</a>. English usually does not. The style of English is that meaning is made clear more by <a href="/Context_(language)" title="Context (language)">context</a>.</p>
<p>The history of the <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> has added to the spread of English. English is an important language in many places today. In <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, and the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, among others (those in the <a href="/Commonwealth" title="Commonwealth">Commonwealth</a>), English is the main language. Because the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (the country where England is) and the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> have historically been powerful in <a href="/Commerce" title="Commerce">commerce</a> and government, many people find it helpful to learn English to <a href="/Communication" title="Communication">communicate</a> in science, business, and <a href="/Diplomacy" title="Diplomacy">diplomacy</a>. This is called learning English as an additional language, <a href="/English_as_a_second_language" title="English as a second language">English as a Second Language</a> (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL).</p>
<p><a href="/English_literature" title="English literature">English literature</a> has many famous stories and plays. <a href="/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> was a famous English writer of <a href="/Poem" title="Poem">poems</a> and <a href="/Play_(theatre)" title="Play (theatre)">plays</a>. His English is <a href="/Early_Modern_English" title="Early Modern English">Early Modern English</a>, and not quite like what people speak or write today. Later, many <a href="/Short_story" title="Short story">short stories</a> and <a href="/Novel" title="Novel">novels</a> also used English. The novel as we know it is first seen in 18th century English.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Today, many famous <a href="/Song" title="Song">songs</a> and <a href="/Movie" title="Movie">movies</a> (cinema films) use the English language.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spelling_differences">Spelling differences</span></h2>
<p>English uses strange <a href="/Orthography" title="Orthography">spelling</a> when written. Different words can use the same letters and combinations for very different sounds. For example, "-ough" has become different in "through" (threw), "rough" (ruff), "dough" (doe) or "cough" (coff). This makes it a very difficult language to learn.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-age"><a href="#_note-age" title="">[10]</a></sup> Many English speaking countries spell words differently. In the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, some words are spelled differently from the way they are spelled in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and many other countries (such as those of the <a href="/British_Commonwealth" title="British Commonwealth">British Commonwealth</a>) where English is the main language. These different ways of spelling are sometimes called "American English" and "British English". For example, "colour" is spelled "color" in the USA, and "programme" is spelled "program" in the USA. Even the word "spelled" is different in British English, where it is "spelt". </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</span></h2>


<p>
Nearly 60% of the <a href="/Vocabulary" title="Vocabulary">vocabulary</a> in the English language comes from Latin and Neo-Latin languages (mainly French):</p>

<ul>
<li><i><a href="/Langues_d'o%C3%AFl" title="Langues d'oïl">Langue d'oïl</a> (French)</i>: 29.3%</li>
<li><a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>, including modern scientific and technical Latin: 28.7%</li>
<li><a href="/Germanic_languages" title="Germanic languages">Germanic languages</a>: 24% (inherited from <a href="/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a>/Anglo-Saxon, Proto-Germanic, <a href="/Old_Norse" title="Old Norse">Old Norse</a>, etc. without including Germanic words borrowed from a Romance languages)</li>
<li>Greek: 5.32%</li>
<li>Italian, Spanish and Portuguese: 4.03%</li>
<li>Derived from proper names: 3.28%</li>
<li>All other languages: less than 1%</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in the most common words, the amount of Germanic origin words is much higher.
Also, besides the simple vocabulary, there are expressions and typical short phrases, many of which are of Germanic origin.</p>
