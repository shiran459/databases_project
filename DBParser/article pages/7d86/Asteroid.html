An <b>asteroid</b> is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>. It is like a <a href="/Planet" title="Planet">planet</a> but smaller. They range from less than 1 km (over 1000 feet) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have <a href="/Asteroid_moon" title="Asteroid moon">asteroid moons</a>.</p>
<p>The name "asteroid" means "like a star" in the ancient <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek language</a>. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>, while stars only seem to move because the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own <a href="/Light" title="Light">light</a>. Because of this, some people think "asteroids" is not a good name, and think that the name "planetoid" ("like a planet") would be a better name.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. It was named <a href="/1_Ceres" title="1 Ceres">1 Ceres</a>, and is the biggest object in the <a href="/Asteroid_belt" title="Asteroid belt">asteroid belt</a>. Other asteroids in the asteroid belt, like <a href="/3_Juno" title="3 Juno">Juno</a>, <a href="/2_Pallas" title="2 Pallas">2 Pallas</a>, and <a href="/4_Vesta" title="4 Vesta">4 Vesta</a> were found later. Today, astronomers using computerized <a href="/Telescope" title="Telescope">telescopes</a> find thousands of asteroids every month.  </p>
<p>Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the <a href="/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a>. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide but  some are made of <a href="/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> or <a href="/Metal" title="Metal">metal</a>. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various kinds in including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).</p>
<p>Most asteroids in our <a href="/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> are in the <a href="/Asteroid_belt" title="Asteroid belt">asteroid belt</a> between <a href="/Mars_(planet)" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a> and <a href="/Jupiter_(planet)" title="Jupiter (planet)">Jupiter</a>. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called <a href="/Near-Earth_asteroid" title="Near-Earth asteroid">Near-Earth asteroids</a>. Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off <a href="/K/T_extinction_event" title="K/T extinction event">all the dinosaurs</a> and caused some of the other <a href="/Extinction_event" title="Extinction event">extinction events</a>.</p>
