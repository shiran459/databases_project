<p>
Beheading means cutting the convict's head off. It is one of the oldest execution methods and already mentioned in the <a href="/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>. Beheading used to be the standard method of execution in Scandinavia and Germany. Commoners were usually beheaded with an <a href="/Axe" title="Axe">axe</a> and noblemen with a <a href="/Sword" title="Sword">sword</a>. A special device, like <a href="/Guillotine" title="Guillotine">guillotine</a>, can also be used, as in France. <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> used guillotine to execute criminal convicts, such as murderers.</p>
<p>Centuries ago many countries used beheading as an execution for important people, including England. In England, many noblemen and even some kings and queens have been beheaded. There, the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say a speech. Then, he/she would be blindfolded and put his/her neck onto a block. Then, the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victim's neck. If the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp, then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke. But if the executioner was inexperienced, then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off.</p>
