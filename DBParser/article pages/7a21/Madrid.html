<p>
During the history of <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> many different people have lived there. The <a href="/Phoenician" title="Phoenician">Phoenicians</a> came in 1100 BC, followed by <a href="/Carthaginian" title="Carthaginian">Carthaginians</a>, <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>, <a href="/Vandals" title="Vandals">Vandals</a>, <a href="/Visigoth" title="Visigoth">Visigoths</a> and <a href="/Moor" title="Moor">Moors</a>. It was not until <a href="/1492" title="1492">1492</a>, when the <a href="/Catholic_Monarchs" title="Catholic Monarchs">Catholic Monarchs</a> got power, that Spain became a united country. <a href="/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</a> and Moors, who had lived happily there for many years, were driven away. Spain became very rich because it conquered many overseas countries, especially in <a href="/Central_America" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. However, Spain fought many wars and lost much of its <a href="/Treasure" title="Treasure">treasure</a>. It was very poor in <a href="/1936" title="1936">1936</a> when the <a href="/Civil_War" title="Civil War">Civil War</a> was fought. General Franco became a harsh <a href="/Dictator" title="Dictator">dictator</a> until <a href="/1975" title="1975">1975</a> when <a href="/Juan_Carlos_I" title="Juan Carlos I">Juan Carlos I</a> was brought back to Spain and made king. There is now a democratic government.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Prehistoric" title="Prehistoric">prehistoric</a> times people lived in the area which is now Madrid. The Romans lived there for several centuries. The origin of today’s city really starts in the <a href="/9th_century" title="9th century">9th century</a> when Muhammad I had a small <a href="/Palace" title="Palace">palace</a> built where the Palacio Real stands today. The Moors built strong forts in Madrid in <a href="/865" title="865">865</a> and put a wall round the city. These walls stood until <a href="/1476" title="1476">1476</a> when they were knocked down. In <a href="/1561" title="1561">1561</a> <a href="/Felipe_I" title="Felipe I">Felipe I</a> moved the royal court from <a href="/Toledo%2C_Spain" title="Toledo, Spain">Toledo</a> to Madrid. Madrid had now become the capital of a very large <a href="/Empire" title="Empire">empire</a>. Over the next years and <a href="/Decade" title="Decade">decades</a> the <a href="/Plaza_Mayor" title="Plaza Mayor">Plaza Mayor</a> was built and many great buildings and monuments, many of which still stand.</p>
<p>When <a href="/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon" title="Ferdinand II of Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and Queen <a href="/Isabella_of_Castile" title="Isabella of Castile">Isabella of Castile</a> came to Madrid, Spain had become a very rich country. The <a href="/16th_century" title="16th century">16th</a> and <a href="/17th_century" title="17th century">17th centuries</a> are now known as the “Golden Century”. Their grandson was the famous <a href="/Charles_I_of_Spain" title="Charles I of Spain">Charles I of Spain</a> (also known as <a href="/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</a>). He liked his court to be in <a href="/Sevilla" title="Sevilla">Seville</a>. His son, <a href="/Philip_II_of_Spain" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II</a> (1527–1598) moved the <a href="/Court" title="Court">court</a> to Madrid in 1561. </p>  
<p>In the late 1800s there was a revolt, known as the <a href="/First_Spanish_Republic" title="First Spanish Republic">First Spanish Republic</a>. Later the monarchy was restored, but then there was a <a href="/Second_Spanish_Republic" title="Second Spanish Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a> followed by the <a href="/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The Second Spanish Republic started on 14 April 1931 and was celebrated in La puerta del Sol which is the center of the city. Madrid suffered a lot in this war. It was bombed by airplanes.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/Dictatorship" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> of <a href="/Francisco_Franco" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a>, especially during the <a href="/1960" title="1960">1960s</a>, the south of Madrid became very industrialized, and many people from the <a href="/Rural" title="Rural">rural</a> areas moved to Madrid especially to the south east of the city.</p>
<p>When General Franco had died and democracy was restored, Madrid became more prosperous. During the <a href="/1980" title="1980">1980s</a> and <a href="/1990" title="1990">1990s</a> many new buildings were put up.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>
<p>The region of Madrid has quite a dry climate. Most rain falls in <a href="/Autumn" title="Autumn">autumn</a> and <a href="/Spring" title="Spring">spring</a>. The winters are cold because it is so high up, and sometimes there is snow. The summers are hot. Often the temperature is above 30 °C (86 °F) in July and can often reach 40 °C (104 °F). At night it is much cooler. This is why people have a sleep (siesta) in the afternoon when it is too hot to do anything. Then they come out again in the evening and often eat dinner late at night.</p>
