<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Provinces_and_counties">Provinces and counties</span></h2>
<p>Ireland is traditionally divided into four provinces and thirty-two counties. Twenty-six counties are in the Republic and six in Northern Ireland. Three of the provinces are entirely within the Republic (Connacht, Leinster and Munster), and one province (Ulster) has some counties in both the Republic and in Northern Ireland.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>During the last glacial period (the "ice age"), most of Ireland was covered with ice. After that, Ireland became covered with trees. The first people came to Ireland about 9,000 years ago, in the Middle <a href="/Stone_Age" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> (Mesolithic period). They were nomadic. Once food ran out in the place they lived, they would move to another place. Evidence of these people was found in Mount Sandel, Co. Derry. </p>
<p>About 4000 BC, in the New Stone Age (Neolithic period), the first farmers arrived in Ireland. These people cleared openings in the forest and built permanent settlements with houses and farmland. When people in this age died, they were buried in tombs called megaliths. Many megaliths are left standing today, such as portal dolmens and passage tombs. The most famous megalith is Newgrange passage tomb in co. Meath. </p>
<p>New settlers came around 2000BC, marking the start of the <a href="/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>. Copper was mined mainly in Mount Gabriel, co. Cork, and tin was imported from Cornwall. These people used bronze to make weapons, such as swords. They also used it to make early forms of jewellery, such as sun discs and torcs. These settlers buried the dead in court tombs or wedge tombs, and burial places have been found with stone circles. </p>
<p>It is unknown when the <a href="/Celts" title="Celts">Celts</a> came to Ireland, but it is likely they brought the use of iron with them. The use of iron marks the start of the <a href="/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>. It is known that by about 300BC, the use of iron and Celtic culture was widespread in Ireland. The Celts lived in ring forts, hill forts, promontory forts and crannógs. It is thought that only the richer families and settlements lived in crannógs. These were man-made islands in the middle of lakes with houses on them. </p>
<p>Celtic Ireland was split into around 150 kingdoms called tuath. The king was elected from the royal family. Below the king were the Nobles, and the Aos Dána, who were people with special skills, such as poets, Druids (priests), judges and craftsmen. </p>
<p>By the early 6th century, Ireland was mostly Christian through the work of <a href="/St._Patrick" title="St. Patrick">St. Patrick</a> and other missionaries. <a href="/Druids" title="Druids">Druids</a> were replaced by priests and monks. Monasteries soon were built such as Glendalough in co. Wicklow. Glendalough and other monasteries built round towers for safety when <a href="/Vikings" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> attacked. Small monasteries were also built in remote places, the most famous being Skellig Michael, off the coast of co. Kerry. </p>
<p>At this time many hand-written manuscripts were created by the monasteries. They include the Cathach, the Book of Durrow, and the Book of Kells. Monks also produced fine silver chalices, croziers and brooches, and carved high crosses. </p>
<p>In 1169, <a href="/Anglo-Norman" title="Anglo-Norman">Anglo-Norman</a> lords invaded Ireland. They were led by <a href="/Strongbow" title="Strongbow">Strongbow</a>. He landed at Passage, Co. Waterford. The Anglo-Normans conquered many parts of Ireland the following 60 years. They introduced their way of life. The feudal system was soon introduced in Ireland as means of organising land. Castles were built to defend the land like Trim Castle, co. Meath. During the Middle Ages, Ireland's first proper towns were built. </p>
<p>From 1801 until 1922, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and 'partitioned' from the south. Northern Ireland has stayed within the United Kingdom since then. The full name of the UK is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.</p>
<p>In 1922 the south became the <a href="/Irish_Free_State" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a>. In 1937 the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution which named the state '<a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>', and in 1948 this state passed the Republic of Ireland Act which declared it to be a <a href="/Republic" title="Republic">republic</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Migration">Migration</span></h2>
<p>Many Irish people have left Ireland and moved to the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. The <a href="/Irish_Potato_Famine" title="Irish Potato Famine">Great Famine</a> in the 1840's forced many to leave; it is estimated almost a million people died of starvation, and a million more emigrated. From a maximum of over 8 million in 1841, the total Irish population dropped to just over 4 million in the 1940s. Since then, the population has grown to over 6 million. This has been helped by the economic growth of the "Celtic Tiger" and since 2004 immigration from countries in <a href="/Eastern_Europe" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> such as <a href="/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>.</p>
<p>Today almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish immigrants.</p>
