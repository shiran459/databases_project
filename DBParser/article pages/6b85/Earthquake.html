<p>An <b>earthquake</b> (or quakes, tremors) is shaking of the surface of earth, caused by <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sudden">sudden</a> movement in the <a href="/Crust_(geology)" title="Crust (geology)">Earth's crust</a>. They can be extremely violent.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are usually quite brief, but may repeat. They are the result of a sudden release of energy in the <a href="/Earth's_crust" title="Earth's crust">Earth's crust</a>. This creates seismic waves, which are waves of energy that travel through the Earth.  The study of earthquakes is called <a href="/Seismology" title="Seismology">seismology</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-camilla"><a href="#_note-camilla" title="">[1]</a></sup>Seismology studies the frequency, type and size of earthquakes over a period of time. </p>
<p>There are <a href="/Large" title="Large">large</a> earthquakes and <a href="/Small" title="Small">small</a> earthquakes. Large earthquakes can take down buildings and cause death and injury. Earthquakes are measured using observations from <a href="/Seismometer" title="Seismometer">seismometers</a>. The magnitude of an earthquake, and the intensity of shaking, is usually reported on the <a href="/Richter_scale" title="Richter scale">Richter scale</a>. On the scale, 3 or less is scarcely noticeable, and magnitude 7 (or more) causes damage over a wide area.</p>
<p>An earthquake under the <a href="/Ocean" title="Ocean">ocean</a> can cause a <a href="/Tsunami" title="Tsunami">tsunami</a>.  This can cause just as much death and destruction as the earthquake itself.  <a href="/Landslide" title="Landslide">Landslides</a> can happen, too. Earthquakes are part of the Earth's <a href="/Rock_cycle" title="Rock cycle">rock cycle</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds of thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the <a href="/Pacific_Ring_of_Fire" title="Pacific Ring of Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a> but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or <a href="/Volcanic_eruption" title="Volcanic eruption">volcanic eruptions</a> are frequent.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Ancient_China" title="Ancient China">ancient Chinese</a> used a device that looked like a jar with <a href="/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragons</a> on the top surrounded by frogs with their mouths open.  When an earthquake occurred, a ball in each dragon's mouth would drop out of the dragon's mouth into the frog's.  The position of the frog which received a ball indicated the direction of the earthquake.  This was one of the first tools to help figure out where an earthquake originated from.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Causes_of_an_earthquake">Causes of an earthquake</span></h2>
<p>{{main|plate tectonics}}
Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is that when <a href="/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">tectonic plates</a> , one rides over the other, causing <a href="/Orogeny" title="Orogeny">orogeny</a> collide (mountain building), earthquakes.</p>
<p>The boundaries between moving plates form the largest <a href="/Fault_(geology)" title="Fault (geology)">fault</a> surfaces on Earth. When they stick, relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the <a href="/Potential_energy" title="Potential energy">stored energy</a> as <a href="/Shock_wave" title="Shock wave">shock wave</a>s.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Earthquake_fault_types">Earthquake fault types</span></h2>


<p>There are three main types of <a href="/Fault_(geology)" title="Fault (geology)">geological fault</a> that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Earthquake_clusters">Earthquake clusters</span></h2>
<p>Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-WAAFEC"><a href="#_note-WAAFEC" title="">[2]</a></sup> Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <b>foreshock</b> is an earthquake that occurs before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock. </p>
<p>An <b><a href="/Aftershock" title="Aftershock">aftershock</a></b> is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-WAAFEC_b"><a href="#_note-WAAFEC" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Earthquake swarms</b> are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at <a href="/Yellowstone_National_Park" title="Yellowstone National Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in a sort of <b>earthquake storm</b>, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern occurred in the North <a href="/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolian</a> fault in <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> in the 20th century.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tsunami">Tsunami</span></h2>
<p>{{main|Tsunami}}
</p>


<p>
<b>Tsunami</b> or a <a href="/Chain" title="Chain">chain</a> of fast moving <a href="/Wave" title="Wave">waves</a> in the <a href="/Ocean" title="Ocean">ocean</a> caused by powerful earthquakes is a very serious challenge for people's safety and for <a href="/Earthquake_engineering" title="Earthquake engineering">earthquake engineering</a>. Those waves can inundate coastal areas, destroy <a href="/House" title="House">houses</a> and even swipe away whole <a href="/Town" title="Town">towns</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, tsunamis can not be prevented. However, there are warning systems<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> which may warn the <a href="/Population" title="Population">population</a> before the big waves reach the <a href="/Land" title="Land">land</a> to let them enough time to rush to safety.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Earthquake-proofing">Earthquake-proofing</span></h2>
<p>{{main|Earthquake engineering}}
Some places, such as <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> or <a href="/California" title="California">California</a>, have many earthquakes and many inhabitants. There, it is good practice to construct <a href="/House" title="House">houses</a> and other <a href="/Building" title="Building">buildings</a> which will resist collapse in an earthquake. This is called seismic design or "<a href="/Earthquake-proof" title="Earthquake-proof">earthquake-proofing</a>".
</p>


<p>Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> distribution, and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rigid">rigidity</a>. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than <a href="/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a>. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, hollow columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the hollow columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake.</p>
<p>To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or <a href="/Reinforced_concrete" title="Reinforced concrete">reinforced concrete</a>. During an earthquake flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don’t break.</p>
