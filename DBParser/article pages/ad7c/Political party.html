<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="About">About</span></h2>
<p>A political party is similar to a <a href="/Political_faction" title="Political faction">faction</a>, and can be the same thing. In some systems, members of one party in the <a href="/Legislature" title="Legislature">legislature</a> are all expected to vote the same way. The laws written by the party or faction with the majority of votes become adopted by the country, so this means whatever party is elected to over half the seats, gets to run the government. The next largest party is often called the "opposition". Sometimes when there are more than two parties with seats, no one party has over half of the seats. Then two or more parties might join together to form what is called a "coalition".</p>
<p>Some parties are formed around a single issue or interest group. Others form policies to address all matters of government, known as a "platform".</p>
<p>Many political parties have a set of ideas and beliefs (called its "<a href="/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideology</a>"). People often describe these ideologies using words such as "trump" and "hillary". </p>
<p>Common ideologies include <a href="/Environmentalism" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a>, <a href="/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a> (ranging from <a href="/Social_democracy" title="Social democracy">social democracy</a> to <a href="/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>), <a href="/Conservatism" title="Conservatism">conservatism</a>, <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a>, <a href="/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>, and <a href="/Nationalism" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_law">The law</span></h2>

<p>Political parties can be against the law in some places. When some parties get a lot of <a href="/Influence" title="Influence">power</a>, they can make all other political parties illegal. For example, the <a href="/Nazi_Party" title="Nazi Party">Nazi Party</a> did this in <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and the <a href="/Communist" title="Communist">Communist</a> Party did it in several countries. Some countries make extreme-right parties illegal (such as <a href="/Vlaams_Blok" title="Vlaams Blok">Vlaams Blok</a> in Belgium). At other times, countries have outlawed far-left parties. For example, <a href="/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a> banned the Communist Party in 1956.</p>
<p>A handful of countries like <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/North_Korea" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> and <a href="/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> still have one-party dictatorships. In a few other dictatorships, such as <a href="/Saudi_Arabia" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, all political parties are banned and there is no parliament at all.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Importance_in_all_big_democracies">Importance in all big democracies</span></h2>

<p>In all big democratic countries, parties are very important. But there are a few very small countries, such as the island of <a href="/Jersey" title="Jersey">Jersey</a>, where most politicians do not belong to any party and where parties do not matter much.</p>
<p>In some democracies, there are only two big political parties. For example, in the United States, there is the <a href="/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a> and the <a href="/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a>. Some other parties exist but are very small and do not hold seats in Congress.</p>
<p>In other countries there are larger numbers of parties. In the German federal Parliament (or Bundestag), six parties have seats. In the United Kingdom, there are two big parties, one medium-sized party, and many small ones.</p>
