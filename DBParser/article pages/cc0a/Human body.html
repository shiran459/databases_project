<p>
Some people <a href="/Research" title="Research">study</a> the human body. They look at where it is different from or the same as other <a href="/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a>' bodies. These animals can be alive today. Or they can be <a href="/Extinct" title="Extinct">extinct</a> animals like other <a href="/Hominid" title="Hominid">hominids</a>. (Hominids are <a href="/Primate" title="Primate">primates</a> that are close to humans. <a href="/Neanderthal" title="Neanderthal">Neanderthals</a> and <i><a href="/Homo_erectus" title="Homo erectus">Homo erectus</a></i> were hominids.) Some people study how the human body works and lives in its <a href="/Environment" title="Environment">environment</a>. Some people study what people think about their body. Artists study how to draw or paint the human body.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fields_of_study">Fields of study</span></h2>
<p>Many different fields of study look at the human:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Biology" title="Biology">Biology</a> is a field of <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a>. It studies living things. It looks at how the human body works. It studies how the human body came from <a href="/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. It studies how <a href="/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetics</a> makes the human body.
<ul>
<li><a href="/Anatomy" title="Anatomy">Anatomy</a> studies the parts of the body and how they work together.</li>
<li><a href="/Ecology" title="Ecology">Ecology</a> studies the environment including how humans affect it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">Anthropology</a> is a field of science. It compares humans to other <a href="/Hominid" title="Hominid">hominids</a>. It also studies all other hominid bodies. They look at how <a href="/Human" title="Human">humans</a> and <a href="/Chimpanzee" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a> are the same or different.</li>
<li><a href="/Psychology" title="Psychology">Psychology</a> is a field of <a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">medicine</a>. It looks at how people think and feel. The <a href="/Brain" title="Brain">brain</a> is part of the body. How we think and feel comes from the brain. So psychologists study the body. They study how the brain lets us be who we are.</li>
<li><a href="/Religion" title="Religion">Religion</a> also talks about the body. Some religions see the body as where the <a href="/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a> lives. Some see the body as like a <a href="/Church" title="Church">church</a>. This is because a church is where people <a href="/Worship" title="Worship">worship</a> <a href="/God" title="God">God</a>. These people think God should be worshiped inside people. Some religions think the body is made from <a href="/Chakras" title="Chakras">chakras</a> that connect us to the <a href="/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/Medicine" title="Medicine">Medicine</a> sees the body like a <a href="/Machine" title="Machine">machine</a>. <a href="/Medical_doctor" title="Medical doctor">Doctors</a> want to fix problems with the body. They study how to fix the problems, called <a href="/Disease" title="Disease">diseases</a>.The biggest bone in your body is your thigh bone.</li>
</ul>

<p>The human body is like other animals. The <a href="/Skeleton" title="Skeleton">skeleton</a>, <a href="/Muscle" title="Muscle">muscles</a> and other parts are very much like those of other <a href="/Primate" title="Primate">primates</a>. Our body is also like other <a href="/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, and somewhat like other <a href="/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>. <a href="/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> differnces follow a similar pattern. Our DNA is closer to that of other primates, than it is to other vertebrates.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="DNA_sequence_differences_between_humans_and_chimpanzees">DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees</span></h3>
<p>The animal that is alive now that is closest to humans is the <a href="/Chimpanzee" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>. <b>98.4%</b> of the DNA is the same between humans and chimpanzees. However, this applies only to single nucleotide <a href="/Polymorphism" title="Polymorphism">polymorphisms</a>, that is, changes in <i>single</i> base pairs only. The full picture is rather different.</p>
<p>The draft sequence of the <a href="/Common_chimpanzee" title="Common chimpanzee">common chimpanzee</a> <a href="/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a> was published in 2005. It showed that the regions which are similar enough to be aligned with one another account for 2400 million of the human genome’s 3164.7 million bases,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Consortium"><a href="#_note-Consortium" title="">[1]</a></sup> that is, <b>75.8% of the genome</b>. </p>
<p>This 75.8% of the human genome is 1.23% different from the chimpanzee genome in single-nucleotide polymorphisms<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Consortium_b"><a href="#_note-Consortium" title="">[1]</a></sup> (SNPs - changes of single DNA “letters” in the genome). Another type of difference, called 'indels' (insertions/deletions) account for another ~3% difference between the alignable sequences.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Consortium_c"><a href="#_note-Consortium" title="">[1]</a></sup> In addition, variation in copy number of large segments (&gt; 20 kb) of similar DNA sequence provides a further 2.7% difference between the two species.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Cheng"><a href="#_note-Cheng" title="">[2]</a></sup> Hence the total similarity of the genomes could be as low as about 70%.</p>
