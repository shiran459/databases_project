<p>A <b>trademark</b> (or <b>trade mark</b>) is a way for a business to help people to identify the <a href="/Product_(consumer_goods)" title="Product (consumer goods)">products</a> that the business makes from products made by another business. A trademark can be a <a href="/Name" title="Name">name</a>, word, <a href="/Phrase" title="Phrase">phrase</a>, <a href="/Symbol" title="Symbol">symbol</a>, <a href="/Logo" title="Logo">logo</a>, <a href="/Design" title="Design">design</a>, or <a href="/Picture" title="Picture">picture</a>. It can only be used on things made by the business that owns the trademark. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="/Coca-Cola" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> and Coke are trademark names for a certain drink made by the Coca-Cola Company. No other business can use these names or any names similar to them. Other businesses can make a drink that is similar, like <a href="/Cola" title="Cola">colas</a> soft drinks, but they have to use a different name for their drink, such as <a href="/Pepsi" title="Pepsi">Pepsi</a>.</p>
<p>Another example is the <a href="/Nike%2C_Inc." title="Nike, Inc.">Nike</a> company which makes sporting goods like <a href="/Shoes" title="Shoes">shoes</a> and <a href="/Clothes" title="Clothes">clothes</a>. The "swoosh" symbol used on their products is a trademark.</p>
<p>Famous trademarks like Coca-Cola and Nike are used for <a href="/Brand" title="Brand">branding</a> whole families of products.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_a_trademark">Getting a trademark</span></h3>
<p>Trademarks are protected by <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a>. In some countries, a person or company can get a trademark simply by using the name, word, phrase, symbol, logo, design, or picture on its products.</p>
<p>Trademarks can also be registered. In that case, the business tells the <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> of its <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a> that it wants to use a certain name, word, phrase, symbol, logo, design or picture as a trademark for the products it sells. If no other person or business is using the trademark to sell those products, then the government will list that trademark. Once it is listed, no one else can use that trademark for those products. This is called "<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/register">registering</a>" the trademark.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_another_person.27s_trademark">Using another person's trademark</span></h3>
<p>If someone uses the trademark in a wrong way, the trademark owner can <a href="/Lawsuit" title="Lawsuit">sue</a> the other person. If a <a href="/Court" title="Court">court</a> decides that the other person was not allowed to use the trademark, they might have to pay a <a href="/Fine" title="Fine">fine</a> to the trademark owner. </p>
<p>If another person wants to use a trademark that they do not own, they can ask the trademark owner for <a href="/Permission" title="Permission">permission</a>.  The trademark owner can grant the other person a <a href="/License" title="License">license</a>.  The other person usually must pay some <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> to the trademark owner for the license.  This can be in the form of a <a href="/Percentage" title="Percentage">percentage</a> of the cost of the product that the other person sells called a royalty. For example, a person might pay Nike ten percent (10%) of the cost of each pair of <a href="/Shoe" title="Shoe">shoes</a> it sells for the right to include the Swoosh.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Marking_products_with_trademarks">Marking products with trademarks</span></h3>
<p>When people write a word that is a trademark or show a picture or symbol that is a trademark, they should say that it is a trademark. If a trademark is not registered, they can write the word "Trademark", use the <a href="/Abbreviation" title="Abbreviation">abbreviation</a> "TM", or use the symbol <b>™</b> on their products. </p>
<p>If a trademark is registered, they can use the letter R in a circle symbol: "®". People can also say it is a "registered trademark" or use the abbreviation "Reg."</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Service_marks">Service marks</span></h2>
<p>Trademarks are used for products.  Businesses that do things for people instead of making things are called <a href="/Service_(economics)" title="Service (economics)">service</a> providers. They can get a <a href="/Service_mark" title="Service mark">service mark</a> instead of a trademark. When people write or show a service mark, they can use the service mark symbol: "℠".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Laws_by_country">Laws by country</span></h2>
<p>In the United States, the governing law for trademarks is the <a href="/Lanham_Act" title="Lanham Act">Lanham Act</a>, in Germany the <a href="/Markengesetz" title="Markengesetz">Markengesetz</a>.</p>
