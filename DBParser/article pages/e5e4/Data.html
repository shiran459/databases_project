The word <b>data</b> means "known <a href="/Facts" title="Facts">facts</a>". Data especially refers to <a href="/Number" title="Number">numbers</a>, but can mean <a href="/Word" title="Word">words</a>, <a href="/Sound" title="Sound">sounds</a>, and <a href="/Image" title="Image">images</a>. <a href="/Metadata" title="Metadata">Metadata</a> is data about data. It is used to find data.</p>
<p>Originally, data is the plural of the <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i>datum,</i> which is rarely used in English. So <b>data</b> often gets used as if it were a singular word. Some people like to say "data are", not "data is".</p>
