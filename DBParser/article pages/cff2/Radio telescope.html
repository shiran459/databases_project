A <b>radio telescope</b> is like a huge <a href="/Satellite" title="Satellite">satellite</a> <a href="/Dish" title="Dish">dish</a>. An ordinary <a href="/Telescope" title="Telescope">telescope</a> allows people to see light from distant objects. Stars shine and the light can be seen with a telescope, but they also give off <a href="/Radio_wave" title="Radio wave">radio waves</a>. <a href="/Scientist" title="Scientist">Scientists</a> with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a> to learn about the stars. Other things like <a href="/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black holes</a> also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too.</p>
<p>The dish is sometimes constructed of a <a href="/Conductive" title="Conductive">conductive</a> wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes, so even very faint signals can be received. Scientists are also trying to do this with ordinary telescopes.</p>
<p>The radio telescope at the <a href="/Parkes_Observatory" title="Parkes Observatory">Parkes Observatory</a>, <a href="/Parkes%2C_New_South_Wales" title="Parkes, New South Wales">Parkes, New South Wales</a> was used by <a href="/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> to receive messages from the <a href="/Apollo_11" title="Apollo 11">Apollo 11</a> moon landings.</p>
