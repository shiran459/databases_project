<p><b>Product stewardship</b> includes <a href="/Waste_disposal" title="Waste disposal">waste disposal</a> measures in the <a href="/Distribution" title="Distribution">distribution</a> of an <a href="/Industrial" title="Industrial">industrial</a> <a href="/Product_(consumer_goods)" title="Product (consumer goods)">product</a>.  That is, paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product, and relying on those who sold it to you, to dispose of it.  </p>
<p>The slightly more specific idea of <b>product take-back</b> means that the service of <a href="/Waste_disposal" title="Waste disposal">waste disposal</a> is paid for at time of <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/purchase">purchase</a>.  It is often applied to <a href="/Paint" title="Paint">paint</a>, <a href="/Tire" title="Tire">tires</a>, and other goods that become <a href="/Toxic_waste" title="Toxic waste">toxic waste</a> if not disposed of properly.  It is most familiar as the <a href="/Deposit_bottle" title="Deposit bottle">deposit bottle</a> - where one pays for the <a href="/Loan" title="Loan">loan</a> of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it. The <b>container deposit</b> charged for a <b>deposit bottle</b> may be a <a href="/Fee" title="Fee">fee</a> to <i>buy</i> the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains.  If one returns the bottle, the fee is returned, and the <a href="/Supplier" title="Supplier">supplier</a> must return the bottle for <a href="/Re-use" title="Re-use">re-use</a> or <a href="/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a>.  If not, one has paid the fee, and <a href="/Presumably" title="Presumably">presumably</a> this can pay for <a href="/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfill</a> or <a href="/Litter" title="Litter">litter</a> control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle.  Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving.  This is quite common for instance among <a href="/Homeless" title="Homeless">homeless</a> people.</p>
<p><a href="/Legal" title="Legal">Legal</a> <a href="/Requirement" title="Requirement">requirements</a> <a href="/Vary" title="Vary">vary</a>:  the bottle itself may be considered simple <a href="/Property" title="Property">property</a> of the purchaser of the contents, or, the purchaser may have some <a href="/Obligation" title="Obligation">obligation</a> to return the bottle to some depot so it can be <a href="/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycled</a> or re-used.   For the more toxic items, it is more likely that returning it is required:</p>
<p>This principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to <a href="/Paint" title="Paint">paint</a> and <a href="/Automobile" title="Automobile">automobile</a> parts such as <a href="/Tire" title="Tire">tires</a>.  When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the <a href="/Toxic_waste" title="Toxic waste">toxic waste</a> they become.  In some countries, such as <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a> requires attention to the <a href="/Comprehensive_outcome" title="Comprehensive outcome">comprehensive outcome</a> of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way.  This is also the trend in the <a href="/UK" title="UK">UK</a> and <a href="/EU" title="EU">EU</a> generally.  In the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, there have been many <a href="/Class_action_suit" title="Class action suit">class action suits</a> that are effectively product stewardship <a href="/Liability" title="Liability">liability</a> - holding companies responsible for things the product does, which it was never advertised to do.</p>
<p>Rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the <a href="/Public_sector" title="Public sector">public sector</a> or be haphazardly <a href="/Assign" title="Assign">assigned</a> one <a href="/Issue" title="Issue">issue</a> at a time to companies via <a href="/Lawsuit" title="Lawsuit">lawsuits</a>, many <a href="/Accounting_reform" title="Accounting reform">accounting reform</a> efforts focus on achieving <a href="/Full_cost_accounting" title="Full cost accounting">full cost accounting</a>.  This is the <a href="/Financial_capital" title="Financial capital">financial</a> reflection of the <a href="/Comprehensive" title="Comprehensive">comprehensive</a> <a href="/Outcome" title="Outcome">outcome</a> - noting the gains and losses to all parties involved, not just those investing or purchasing.  Such moves have made <a href="/Moral_purchasing" title="Moral purchasing">moral purchasing</a> more attractive, as it avoids <a href="/Liability" title="Liability">liability</a> and future lawsuits.</p>
<p>So these are <a href="/Partial" title="Partial">partial</a> <a href="/Implementation" title="Implementation">implementations</a> of a <a href="/Strict" title="Strict">strict</a> <a href="/Service_economy" title="Service economy">service economy</a> <a href="/Ideal" title="Ideal">ideal</a>.</p>
<p>Those who <a href="/Advocate" title="Advocate">advocate</a> these measures are concerned with the later <a href="/Phase" title="Phase">phases</a> of <a href="/Product_lifecycle" title="Product lifecycle">product lifecycle</a> and the <a href="/Comprehensive_outcome" title="Comprehensive outcome">comprehensive outcome</a> of the whole production process.  It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict <a href="/Service_economy" title="Service economy">service economy</a> interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) "commodity" and "product" relationships.</p>
