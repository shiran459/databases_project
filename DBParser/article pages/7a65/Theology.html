<p><b>Theology</b> is the <a href="/Research" title="Research">study</a> of one or more <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religions</a> 
("Theo-" means <a href="/God" title="God">God</a> in <a href="/Greek_language" title="Greek language">Greek</a> and "-logy" is study, which makes it "God study" or "study of God"). Somebody who studies theology is called a theologian. Books or ideas about theology are called theological.</p>
<p>Theology may be studied for many reasons. Some people study theology to better understand their own religion, while other people study theology so that they can compare religions.</p>
<p>The word ‘theology’ was first used to describe the study of God in <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally, but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so. Some people use the words 'comparative theology' when they want to mean discussing the theology of more than one religion at once.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a>, it was thought that theology was the highest <a href="/Humanities" title="Humanities">subject</a> learned in <a href="/University" title="University">universities</a>. Theology at that time was named "The Queen of the <a href="/Science" title="Science">Sciences</a>". There was a plan for young men to study easy subjects and then harder subjects. The easiest subjects were called the <a href="/Trivium_(liberal_arts)" title="Trivium (liberal arts)">Trivium</a>. The next harder subjects were called the <a href="/Quadrivium" title="Quadrivium">Quadrivium</a>. Finally, young men were expected to study theology. This meant that the other subjects existed primarily to help with theological thought.</p>
