<p><b>Graph theory</b> is a field of <a href="/Math" title="Math">mathematics</a> about graphs. A <a href="/Graph" title="Graph">graph</a> is an <a href="/Abstract" title="Abstract">abstract</a> representation of: a number of <a href="/Point_(geometry)" title="Point (geometry)">points</a> that are connected by <a href="/Line" title="Line">lines</a>. Each point is usually called a <i>vertex</i> (more than one are called <i>vertices</i>), and the lines are called <i>edges</i>.  Graphs are a tool for modelling relationships. They are used to find answers to a number of problems.</p>
<p>Some of these questions are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the best way for a <a href="/Mailman" title="Mailman">mailman</a> to get to all of the <a href="/House" title="House">houses</a> in the area in the least amount of <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a>? The points could represent <a href="/Street" title="Street">street</a> corners and lines could represent the houses along the street. (see <a href="/Chinese_postman_problem" title="Chinese postman problem">Chinese postman problem</a>)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>A salesman has to visit different customers, but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible. The problem is to find a way so they can do it. This problem is known as <a href="/Travelling_Salesman_Problem" title="Travelling Salesman Problem">Travelling Salesman Problem</a> (and often abbreviated <i>TSP</i>). It is among the hardest problems to solve. If a commonly believed <a href="/Conjecture" title="Conjecture">conjecture</a> is true (described as <b>P</b> ≠ <b>NP</b>), then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>How many colors would be needed to color a map, if countries sharing a border are colored differently? The points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring. (look at the <a href="/Four_color_theorem" title="Four color theorem">Four color theorem</a>)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Can a sketch be drawn in one closed line? The lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide, there is a point in the graph. The task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time. (look at <a href="/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg" title="Seven Bridges of Königsberg">Seven Bridges of Königsberg</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>Graph theory has many aspects. Graphs can be directed or undirected. An example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city. Some streets in the city are one way streets. This means, that on those parts there is only one direction to follow.</li>
<li>Graphs can be weighted. An example would be a road network, with distances, or with <a href="/Toll" title="Toll">tolls</a> (for roads).</li>
<li>The nodes (the circles in the schematic) of a graph are called <a href="/Vertex" title="Vertex">vertices</a>. The lines connecting the nodes are called <a href="/Edge" title="Edge">edges</a>. There can be no line between two nodes, there can be one line, or there can be multiple lines.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/Leonhard_Euler" title="Leonhard Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> used to live in a town called <i>Königsberg.</i> (Its name changed to <a href="/Kaliningrad" title="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a> in 1946). The town is on the river Pregel. There is an island in the river. There are some bridges across the river. Euler wanted to walk around and use each of the bridges once. He asked if he could do this. In 1736, he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible. Today, this problem is known as the <a href="/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg" title="Seven Bridges of Königsberg">Seven Bridges of Königsberg</a>. The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Biggs"><a href="#_note-Biggs" title="">[1]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>This article, as well as the one written by <a href="/Alexandre-Th%C3%A9ophile_Vandermonde" title="Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde">Vandermonde</a> on the <i><a href="/Knight's_tour" title="Knight's tour">knight problem</a>,</i> carried on with the <i>analysis situs</i> initiated by <a href="/Gottfried_Leibniz" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Leibniz</a>. Euler's formula was about the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a <a href="/Convex" title="Convex">convex</a> <a href="/Polyhedron" title="Polyhedron">polyhedron</a> was studied and generalized by <a href="/Augustin_Louis_Cauchy" title="Augustin Louis Cauchy">Cauchy</a><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Cauchy"><a href="#_note-Cauchy" title="">[2]</a></sup> and <a href="/Simon_Antoine_Jean_L'Huillier" title="Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier">L'Huillier</a>,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Lhuillier"><a href="#_note-Lhuillier" title="">[3]</a></sup> and is at the origin of <a href="/Topology" title="Topology">topology</a>.</p>
<p>Over a century after Euler, <a href="/Arthur_Cayley" title="Arthur Cayley">Cayley</a> studied a special class of graphs, called the <i><a href="/Tree_(graph_theory)" title="Tree (graph theory)">trees</a>. A tree is a graph where there is only one path between two vertices.  Cayley tried to solve a problem from <a href="/Differential_calculus" title="Differential calculus">differential calculus</a>. His solution influenced the development of theoretical <a href="/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. The technique he used mainly focused on listing all graphs which had certain properties. Today, this is called </i>Enumerative graph theory<i>. It developed from Cayleys results, a scientific publication done by  <a href="/George_P%C3%B3lya" title="George Pólya">Pólya</a> between 1935 and 1937 and the generalization of these by <a href="/Nicolaas_Govert_de_Bruijn" title="Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn">De Bruijn</a> in 1959. Cayley linked his results on trees with the contemporary studies of chemical composition.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Cayley1"><a href="#_note-Cayley1" title="">[4]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory. In particular, the term "graph" was introduced by <a href="/James_Joseph_Sylvester" title="James Joseph Sylvester">Sylvester</a> in an article published in 1878 in <i><a href="/Nature_(journal)" title="Nature (journal)">Nature</a></i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Sylvester"><a href="#_note-Sylvester" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the <a href="/Four_color_problem" title="Four color problem">four color problem</a>: "Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors?" This problem was first posed by <a href="/Francis_Guthrie" title="Francis Guthrie">Francis Guthrie</a> in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of <a href="/Augustus_De_Morgan" title="Augustus De Morgan">De Morgan</a> addressed to <a href="/William_Rowan_Hamilton" title="William Rowan Hamilton">Hamilton</a> the same year. Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, <a href="/Alfred_Bray_Kempe" title="Alfred Bray Kempe">Kempe</a>, and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by <a href="/Peter_Guthrie_Tait" title="Peter Guthrie Tait">Tait</a>, <a href="/Percy_John_Heawood" title="Percy John Heawood">Heawood</a>, <a href="/Frank_P._Ramsey" title="Frank P. Ramsey">Ramsey</a> and <a href="/Hugo_Hadwiger" title="Hugo Hadwiger">Hadwiger</a> led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary <a href="/Genus_(mathematics)" title="Genus (mathematics)">genus</a>.  Tait's reformulation generated a new class of problems, the <i>factorization problems</i>, particularly studied by <a href="/Julius_Petersen" title="Julius Petersen">Petersen</a> and <a href="/D%C3%A9nes_K%C5%91nig" title="Dénes Kőnig">Kőnig</a>. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by <a href="/P%C3%A1l_Tur%C3%A1n" title="Pál Turán">Turán</a> in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, <i><a href="/Extremal_graph_theory" title="Extremal graph theory">extremal graph theory</a></i>.</p>
<p>The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century. A proof produced in 1976 by <a href="/Kenneth_Appel" title="Kenneth Appel">Kenneth Appel</a> and <a href="/Wolfgang_Haken" title="Wolfgang Haken">Wolfgang Haken</a>,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-AA1"><a href="#_note-AA1" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-AA2"><a href="#_note-AA2" title="">[7]</a></sup> which involved checking the properties of 1,936 configurations by computer, was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity. A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by <a href="/Neil_Robertson_(mathematician)" title="Neil Robertson (mathematician)">Robertson</a>, <a href="/Paul_Seymour_(mathematician)" title="Paul Seymour (mathematician)">Seymour</a>, <a href="/Daniel_Sanders_(mathematician)" title="Daniel Sanders (mathematician)">Sanders</a> and <a href="/Robin_Thomas_(mathematician)" title="Robin Thomas (mathematician)">Thomas</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-RSST"><a href="#_note-RSST" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of <a href="/Camille_Jordan" title="Camille Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="/Kazimierz_Kuratowski" title="Kazimierz Kuratowski">Kuratowski</a> and <a href="/Hassler_Whitney" title="Hassler Whitney">Whitney</a>. Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra. The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist <a href="/Gustav_Kirchhoff" title="Gustav Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a>, who published in 1845 his <a href="/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws" title="Kirchhoff's circuit laws">Kirchhoff's circuit laws</a> for calculating the <a href="/Voltage" title="Voltage">voltage</a> and <a href="/Electric_current" title="Electric current">current</a> in <a href="/Electric_circuit" title="Electric circuit">electric circuits</a>.</p>

<p>Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science. To many such problems, exact solutions do exist. Many times however, they are very hard to calculate. Therefore, very often, <a href="/Approximation" title="Approximation">approximations</a> are used. There are two kinds of such approximations, <a href="/Monte-Carlo_algorithm" title="Monte-Carlo algorithm">Monte-Carlo algorithms</a> and <a href="/Las-Vegas_algorithm" title="Las-Vegas algorithm">Las-Vegas algorithms</a>.</p>
<p>Graphs are normally represented by two different sets, typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E. The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph. The set E is a binary set, whose pairwise elements are elements of set V. Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices.</p>
<p>If every two nodes have an edge between them, then the graph is called the <i>complete graph</i>.</p>
