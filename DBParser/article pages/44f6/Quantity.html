<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Counting">Counting</span></h2>
<p>Whole numbers (1, 2, 3 ...) are used to count things.  This can be done by pointing to each one.  As things are pointed to, a number is said.  Start with the number one.  Each time another thing is pointed to, the next whole number is used.  When the last thing in a group it pointed to, that number is the quantity of the group. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Measuring">Measuring</span></h2>
<p>Measuring is done with a ruler or a machine.  We put a ruler next to a thing to measure how long it is.  We put things on a scale to measure their <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a>.  Other machines are used to measure other quantities such as <a href="/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a>, <a href="/Speed" title="Speed">speed</a>, <a href="/Electric_current" title="Electric current">electric current</a>, and so on.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Decimal_numbers">Decimal numbers</span></h3>
<p>When measuring things, a whole number might not be the best answer.  A distance might be longer than 5 <a href="/Meter" title="Meter">meters</a>, but less than 6 meters.  Meter sticks are marked off in parts of a meter.  Decimals are formed by marking off a ruler in ten equal parts.  Each part is a tenth.  5.2 meters is a little bit longer than 5 meters.  5.7 meters is a little bit shorter than 6 meters.  Each of these tenths can be marked with ten smaller parts.  The one hundred centimeters on a meter stick are done this way; by marking ten equal parts, then marking ten equal parts of each of those parts.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fraction_numbers">Fraction numbers</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Fraction_(mathematics)" title="Fraction (mathematics)">Fractions</a> are used when there are parts of a whole number.  The dial on a machine may be marked with four parts between each whole number.  A scale with a bag of potatoes may show five and three-quarters kilograms.  This would be almost six kilograms.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_words_.22amount.22_and_.22number.22">The words "amount" and "number"</span></h3>
<p>People often use the word "amount" when they should say "number".  The words "number" and "amount" should be used if a particular number could be put: e.g.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A large amount of sand (because you cannot say "three thousand sands")</li>
<li>A large number of people (because you could say there were 3547 people).</li>
</ul>
