<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aboriginal_people">Aboriginal people</span></h3>


<p>The <a href="/Australian_Aborigine" title="Australian Aborigine">Australian Aboriginal</a> people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-16"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-17"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-18"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the <a href="/Cumberland_Plain" title="Cumberland Plain">Cumberland Plain</a> where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.</p>
<p>Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in <a href="/Victoria%2C_Australia" title="Victoria, Australia">Victoria</a> and <a href="/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>.{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The <a href="/Boomerang" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a> was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.</p>
<p>The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Terra_Australis">Terra Australis</span></h3>
<p>In the 1600s, <a href="/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a> merchants traded with the islands of <a href="/Batavia" title="Batavia">Batavia</a> (now <a href="/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent <a href="/Abel_Tasman" title="Abel Tasman">Abel Tasman</a> on a voyage of discovery and he found <a href="/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, which he named <a href="/Van_Diemen's_Land" title="Van Diemen's Land">Van Diemen's Land</a>. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.</p>
<p>The <a href="/British_Government" title="British Government">British Government</a> was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain <a href="/James_Cook" title="James Cook">James Cook</a> to the <a href="/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. His ship, <i><a href="/HMS_Endeavour" title="HMS Endeavour">HMS Endeavour</a></i>, carried the famous scientists, Sir <a href="/Joseph_Banks" title="Joseph Banks">Joseph Banks</a> and Dr Solander who were going to <a href="/Tahiti" title="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> where they would watch the planet <a href="/Venus_(planet)" title="Venus (planet)">Venus</a> pass in front of the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find "<a href="/Terra_Australis" title="Terra Australis">Terra Australis</a>" (the Land of the South).</p>
<p>The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found <a href="/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the <a href="/Horizon" title="Horizon">horizon</a>. Captain Cook named that bit of land <a href="/Point_Hicks" title="Point Hicks">Point Hicks</a>. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw "New South Wales". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.</p>
<p>Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Settlement">Settlement</span></h3>


<p>In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and <a href="/Gaol" title="Gaol">gaols</a> (<a href="/Jail" title="Jail">jails</a>) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.</p>
<p>By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the <a href="/First_Fleet" title="First Fleet">First Fleet</a> of eleven ships set sail from <a href="/Portsmouth" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain <a href="/Arthur_Phillip" title="Arthur Phillip">Arthur Phillip</a>. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.</p>
<p>Captain Phillip found that <a href="/Botany_Bay" title="Botany Bay">Botany Bay</a> was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was "the finest harbor in the world!" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of <a href="/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="George III of the United Kingdom">King George III</a> of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.</p>
<p>For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.</p>
<p>Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to <a href="/Norfolk_Island" title="Norfolk Island">Norfolk Island</a> and to <a href="/Van_Diemen's_Land" title="Van Diemen's Land">Van Diemen's Land</a> (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.</p>
<p>While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exploration">Exploration</span></h3>


<p>Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the <a href="/Blue_Mountains_(New_South_Wales)" title="Blue Mountains (New South Wales)">Blue Mountains</a>. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 <a href="/Gregory_Blaxland" title="Gregory Blaxland">Gregory Blaxland</a>, <a href="/William_Lawson_(explorer)" title="William Lawson (explorer)">William Lawson</a> and a 17-year-old called <a href="/William_Charles_Wentworth" title="William Charles Wentworth">William Charles Wentworth</a> crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, <a href="/Lachlan_Macquarie" title="Lachlan Macquarie">Lachlan Macquarie</a> founded the town of <a href="/Bathurst%2C_New_South_Wales" title="Bathurst, New South Wales">Bathurst</a> on the other side, 100Â miles from Sydney.</p>
<p>Some people, like Captain <a href="/Charles_Sturt" title="Charles Sturt">Charles Sturt</a> were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year.

<p>The gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.</p>
<p>The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. <a href="/William_Wentworth" title="William Wentworth">William Wentworth</a> started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand <a href="/Parliamentary_democracy" title="Parliamentary democracy">democratic government</a>. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. <a href="/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council" title="New South Wales Legislative Council">New South Wales Legislative Council</a> had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the <a href="/Right_to_vote" title="Right to vote">right to vote</a> was given to all men over 21 in <a href="/South_Australia" title="South Australia">South Australia</a>. The other colonies soon followed.

<p>Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.</p>

<p>Until 1901, Australia was not a <a href="/Nation" title="Nation">nation</a>, it was six separate <a href="/Colony" title="Colony">colonies</a> governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.</p>
<p>In Australia at this time, the <a href="/Trade_union" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> were very strong, and they started a political party, the <a href="/Australian_Labor_Party" title="Australian Labor Party">Australian Labor Party</a>. Australia passed many laws to help the <a href="/Worker" title="Worker">workers</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-22"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1914, the <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">First World War</a> started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/Austria-Hungary" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> and the <a href="/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Australian soldiers were sent to <a href="/Gallipoli_Campaign" title="Gallipoli Campaign">Gallipoli</a>, in the <a href="/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on <a href="/ANZAC_Day" title="ANZAC Day">ANZAC Day</a>. They also fought on the <a href="/Western_Front" title="Western Front">Western Front</a>. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.</p>
<p>Australia had a really hard time in the <a href="/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the <a href="/Japanese_Occupation_of_Singapore" title="Japanese Occupation of Singapore">Fall of Singapore</a> by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the <a href="/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a>, the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.</p>
<p>When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the <a href="/Snowy_Mountains_Scheme" title="Snowy Mountains Scheme">Snowy Mountains Scheme</a>. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and <a href="/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. An important new party, the <a href="/Liberal_Party_(Australia)" title="Liberal Party (Australia)">Liberal Party of Australia</a> was made by <a href="/Robert_Menzies" title="Robert Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then <a href="/Gough_Whitlam" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> won for the <a href="/Australian_Labor_Party" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor Party</a>. Whitlam made changes, but he made the <a href="/Australian_Senate" title="Australian Senate">Senate</a> unhappy and the <a href="/Governor-General_of_Australia" title="Governor-General of Australia">Governor-General</a> sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then <a href="/Malcolm_Fraser" title="Malcolm Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> won a few elections for the <a href="/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and other countries in <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>. Australia became more <a href="/Multicultural" title="Multicultural">multicultural</a>. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool.

<p>In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under <a href="/Bob_Hawke" title="Bob Hawke">Bob Hawke</a> and <a href="/Paul_Keating" title="Paul Keating">Paul Keating</a>, then the Liberal Party under <a href="/John_Howard" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> made lots of changes to the economy.

<p>Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like <a href="/Uluru" title="Uluru">Uluru</a>) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as <a href="/Immigrant" title="Immigrant">immigrants</a> to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are <a href="/Refugee" title="Refugee">refugees</a>.
