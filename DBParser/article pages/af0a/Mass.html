The <b>mass</b> of an object is a <a href="/Measure" title="Measure">measure</a> of an object's resistance to <a href="/Acceleration" title="Acceleration">acceleration</a>, sometimes also called "inertia". A mountain has typically more mass than a rock, for instance. Mass should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of <a href="/Weight" title="Weight">weight</a>. A large mass like the Earth will attract a small mass like a human being with enough force to keep the human being from floating away. "Mass attraction" is another word for gravity, a force that exists between all matter.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Units_of_mass">Units of mass</span></h2>
<p>The unit of mass in the <a href="/International_System_of_Units" title="International System of Units">International System of Units</a> is the <a href="/Kilogram" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a>, which is represented by the symbol 'kg'. Fractions and multiples of this basic unit include the gram (one thousandth of a kg, symbol 'g') and the <a href="/Ton" title="Ton">tonne</a> (one thousand kg), amongst many others.</p>
<p>In some fields or applications, it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings. For instance,
</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic <a href="/Physicist" title="Physicist">physicists</a> deal with the tiny masses of individual <a href="/Atom" title="Atom">atoms</a> and measure them in <a href="/Atomic_mass_unit" title="Atomic mass unit">atomic mass units</a>.</li>
<li>Jewelers normally work with small <a href="/Jewel" title="Jewel">jewels</a> and precious stones where masses are traditionally measured in <a href="/Carat_(mass)" title="Carat (mass)">carats</a>, which correspond to 200 mg or 0.2 g.</li>
<li>The masses of stars are very large and are sometimes expressed in units of <a href="/Solar_mass" title="Solar mass">Solar masses</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries: <a href="/Imperial_unit" title="Imperial unit">Imperial units</a> such as the <a href="/Ounce" title="Ounce">ounce</a> or the <a href="/Pound_(mass)" title="Pound (mass)">pound</a> were in widespread use within the British Empire. Some of them are still popular in the United States, which also uses units like the short <a href="/Ton" title="Ton">ton</a> ton (2,000 pounds) and the long ton (2,240 pounds), not to be confused with the metric tonne (1,000 kg).</p>

<p>Mass is an intrinsic property of the object: it does not depend on its volume, or position in space, for instance. For a long time (at least since the works of <a href="/Antoine_Lavoisier" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> in the second half of the eighteen century), it has been known that the sum of the masses of objects that interact or of the <a href="/Chemical_substance" title="Chemical substance">chemicals</a> that react remain conserved throughout these processes. This remains an excellent approximation for everyday life and even most laboratory work.</p>
<p>However, Einstein has shown through his <a href="/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">special theory of relativity</a> that the mass <i>m</i> of an object moving at speed <i>v</i> with respect to an observer must be higher than the mass of the same object observed at rest <i>m<sub>0</sub></i> with respect to the observer. The applicable formula is</p>
<p><span class="math">m=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}</span></p>
<p>where <i>c</i> stands for the <a href="/Speed_of_light" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>. This change in mass is only important when the speed of the object with respect to the observer becomes a large fraction of <i>c</i>.</p>
