<p>{{main|Blood plasma}}
Blood plasma is the yellow liquid in which blood cells float. Plasma is made up of nutrients, <a href="/Electrolyte" title="Electrolyte">electrolytes</a> (<a href="/Salts" title="Salts">salts</a>), <a href="/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a>, non-protein hormones, waste, <a href="/Lipid" title="Lipid">lipids</a>, and proteins.
These proteins are <a href="/Albumin" title="Albumin">albumin</a>, <a href="/Antibody" title="Antibody">antibodies</a> (also called <i>immunoglobulins</i>), clotting factors, and protein <a href="/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormones</a>. Plasma that does not have the protein <a href="/Fibrinogen" title="Fibrinogen">fibrinogen</a> is called serum and cannot clot. Adults have about 3 liters of plasma. Plasma is a liquid, mostly water (90%). Plasma takes up 55% of  volume.</p>

<p>
{{Main|Red blood cell}}
Another name for red blood cell is <i>erythrocyte</i>. 'Erythro' means red; 'cyte' means cell. <b>RBC</b> is an <a href="/Acronym" title="Acronym">acronym</a> for <b>r</b>ed <b>b</b>lood <b>c</b>ells.</p>
<p>RBCs carry <a href="/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> around our body. <a href="/Cell" title="Cell">Cells</a> in our body need oxygen to live. Cells also make carbon dioxide as a waste.  RBCs bring oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out.</p>
<p>RBCs are filled with <a href="/Haemoglobin" title="Haemoglobin">haemoglobin</a>. This is a protein. It is made to carry a large amount of oxygen. Haemoglobin has <a href="/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a> in it. The iron and oxygen gives haemoglobin its red color. This is why blood is red. <a href="/Erythropoietin" title="Erythropoietin">Erythropoietin</a> promotes the creation of RBCs. <a href="/Blood_type" title="Blood type">Blood type</a> <a href="/Antigen" title="Antigen">antigens</a> are carried on the surface of red cells.</p>
<p>RBCs also help the blood stay normal <a href="/PH" title="PH">pH</a>. The blood needs a to be at a pH of 7.4. If it is much more or less than 7.4 a person can get very sick or die. RBCs are a <a href="/Buffer_solution" title="Buffer solution">buffer</a> for the blood pH. Buffer means that it stops changes in pH. The proteins and the carbon dioxide in the RBC are buffers for the blood.
If you do not have enough RBCs, you will die.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="White_blood_cells">White blood cells</span></h2>
<p><a href="/White_blood_cell" title="White blood cell">White blood cells</a> are a big part of the <a href="/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immune system</a>. They attack things that do not belong in the body. They kill germs such as <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="/Virus" title="Virus">viruses</a>. They kill <a href="/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancer</a> cells. White blood cells also help to fight other toxic substances.</p>
<p>White blood cells find where the germs are, and start to destroy them. WBCs arrive in the blood. They also go out of the blood in places where there is infection. WBCs do this to fight the germs that make the infection. If they go out of the blood to fight an <a href="/Infection" title="Infection">infection</a>, they may return in the <a href="/Lymphatic_system" title="Lymphatic system">lymphatic system</a>. So WBCs are in <a href="/Lymph_nodes" title="Lymph nodes">lymph nodes</a>. </p>
<p>Another name for white blood cell is <i>leukocyte</i>. Leuko means white. -cyte means cell. <b>WBC</b> is an <a href="/Acronym" title="Acronym">acronym</a> for <b>w</b>hite <b>b</b>lood <b>c</b>ell. There are three main kinds of WBCs. They are <a href="/Lymphocyte" title="Lymphocyte">lymphocytes</a>, <a href="/White_blood_cells#Granulocytes" title="White blood cells">granulocytes</a> and <a href="/Monocytes" title="Monocytes">monocytes</a>. Some of the WBCs mature into cells which do similar work in the tissues.</p>
<p>The different WBCs work in different ways. Some WBCs kill and eat germs and cancer cells. Some WBCs make <a href="/Antibody" title="Antibody">antibodies</a>. These are proteins that stick to a cell and tell other WBCs to kill it. Some WBCs make chemicals. They release these chemicals to fight things that do not belong in the body. These chemicals cause <a href="/Inflammation" title="Inflammation">inflammation</a> in a part of the body. When a germ makes someone sick, the body shows it. If a <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> gets under someone's skin and causes an <a href="/Infection" title="Infection">infection</a>, the skin gets red, hot, and painful. This redness, heat, and pain are signs of <i>inflammation</i>. This shows that WBCs are fighting the infection and killing the bacteria.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Platelets">Platelets</span></h2>
<p>Platelets help make blood clot.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> A clot is when the <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquid</a> blood becomes <a href="/Solid" title="Solid">solid</a>. The body makes blood clot when the skin is cut. This stops blood from going out of the skin too much. </p>
<p>For blood to be able to clot is essential. But, rarely, some blood clots are bad. If a blood clot happens in a <a href="/Blood_vessel" title="Blood vessel">blood vessel</a> going to the brain, it can cause a <a href="/Stroke" title="Stroke">stroke</a>. If it happens in a blood vessel going to the heart, it can cause a <a href="/Heart_attack" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a>. This does not usually happen to young, healthy people. </p>
<p>Platelets are not the only things that make clots. There are proteins in the blood that help make clots. Both platelets and <i>clotting proteins</i> are needed to make good clots.</p>

<p>
Blood cells are made in the <a href="/Bone_marrow" title="Bone marrow">bone marrow</a> and in the <a href="/Spleen" title="Spleen">spleen</a>. The bone marrow is the soft material in the middle of bones. Special cells in the bone marrow make most of the blood cells in your body.</p>
<p>Plasma proteins are made mostly by the <a href="/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a>. The water and electrolytes in plasma come from the food and water that you eat.</p>
<p>Although blood is a <a href="/Fluid" title="Fluid">fluid</a>, in some respects it is a kind of <a href="/Connective_tissue" title="Connective tissue">connective tissue</a>. Its cells  originate in <a href="/Bone_marrow" title="Bone marrow">bone marrow</a> and the <a href="/Spleen" title="Spleen">spleen</a>, and in the blood there are potential molecular fibres in the form of <a href="/Fibrinogen" title="Fibrinogen">fibrinogen</a>. These are activated when a <a href="/Blood_clot" title="Blood clot">blood clot</a> forms.</p>
