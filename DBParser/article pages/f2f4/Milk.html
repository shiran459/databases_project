<p>If milk is not kept cold in a <a href="/Refrigerator" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a>, it will become <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sour">sour</a> after some time. When milk is warmed, it turns sour.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/Fermentation" title="Fermentation">Fermentation</a> makes this happen. <a href="/Pediococcus" title="Pediococcus">Lactic acid bacteria</a> change the milk sugar into <a href="/Lactic_acid" title="Lactic acid">lactic acid</a>. Fermentation is used when making <a href="/Dairy_product" title="Dairy product">dairy products</a>. </p>
<p>Milk is often <a href="/Pasteurisation" title="Pasteurisation">pasteurised</a> before humans drink it. It is made into dairy products like <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>, <a href="/Butter" title="Butter">butter</a>, <a href="/Yoghurt" title="Yoghurt">yoghurt</a>, <a href="/Ice_cream" title="Ice cream">ice cream</a>, or <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a>. Pasteurised cows' milk will turn sour if it is not kept in a <a href="/Refrigerator" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a>. Milk should be stored between 1° and 4° <a href="/Celsius" title="Celsius">Celsius</a>. If milk is treated with very high temperatures, it will last longer before spoiling. This means it does not have to be put in the refrigerator until it is opened.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lactose">Lactose</span></h2>
<p>Milk contains a chemical called <a href="/Lactose" title="Lactose">lactose</a>. Babies make an <a href="/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> called <a href="/Lactase" title="Lactase">lactase</a> inside their bodies. Adults make less lactase. If they do not have enough, they may not be able to digest lactose anymore. This problem is called <a href="/Lactose_intolerance" title="Lactose intolerance">lactose intolerance</a> and it affects many adults. There are many medicines that help adults digest lactose. Many lactose-intolerant people drink <a href="/Soy_milk" title="Soy milk">soy milk</a> instead of animal milk, because it does not contain lactose. Soy milk tastes similar to animal milk, but it is chemically very different and is made from <a href="/Soy_bean" title="Soy bean">soybeans</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Goat_milk">Goat milk</span></h2>
<p>Goat's milk is the milk from a <a href="/Goat" title="Goat">goat</a>. It can be drunk, both by humans or baby goats, or cheese can be made from it. This cheese is called <a href="/Goat's_milk_cheese" title="Goat's milk cheese">goat's milk cheese</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Coconut_milk">Coconut milk</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Coconut_milk" title="Coconut milk">Coconut milk</a> is not real milk because it comes from a plant instead of an animal. However, it looks similar to real milk because it is white. It also does not have as many nutrients as real milk. It is made by removing the white "meat" from a <a href="/Coconut" title="Coconut">coconut</a>, pressing or squeezing the "meat", then adding water. It is sometimes used in <a href="/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a>, for example, in <a href="/Thai_food" title="Thai food">Thai</a> <a href="/Curry" title="Curry">curry</a>.
Coconut cream is a thicker version of coconut milk which contains added sugar.</p>

<p>Milk forms an important part of a person's daily balanced diet. It contains a lot of <a href="/Calcium" title="Calcium">calcium</a> that helps bones and teeth to grow stronger. Also, milk provides the body with high quality <a href="/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>, and helps in meeting the body's requirement for vitamins. One glass of milk gives about 44% to the recommended daily vitamins intake. Some kind of milks, though, do not have good calcium. These kind of milk products include <a href="/Cream" title="Cream">cream</a>, <a href="/Cottage" title="Cottage">cottage</a> <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a>, ricotta cheese, and <a href="/Cream_cheese" title="Cream cheese">cream cheese</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
