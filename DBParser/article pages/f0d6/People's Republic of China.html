A.D. 10th century).  Home of  <a href="/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="/Daoism" title="Daoism">Daoism</a>, it had great influence on nearby countries including <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/Korea" title="Korea">Korea</a>, and <a href="/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, and even writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of <a href="/Jade" title="Jade">jade</a>, are some classic examples.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="/Qin_Dynasty" title="Qin Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a> united China, there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. This is known as the <a href="/Warring_States_Period" title="Warring States Period">Warring States Period</a>. Although the continuing wars made people suffer, it was at this time when many of the great <a href="/Eastern_philosophy" title="Eastern philosophy">philosophies of the East</a> were born, including <a href="/Confucianism" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="/Daoism" title="Daoism">Daoism</a>. Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern-Asian cultures today.</p>
<p>Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied. It was often attacked by northern <a href="/Nomadic_people" title="Nomadic people">nomadic people</a> such as the <a href="/Turkic_peoples" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic tribes</a> and the <a href="/Mongol" title="Mongol">Mongols</a> lead by <a href="/Genghis_Khan" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> and <a href="/Kublai_Khan" title="Kublai Khan">Kublai Khan</a>. During the history of ancient China, the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China. However, when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom, they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese. Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people, including the <a href="/Qing_Dynasty" title="Qing Dynasty">Qin</a>, <a href="/Tang_Dynasty" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang</a>, <a href="/Yuan_Dynasty" title="Yuan Dynasty">Yuan</a> (Mongolian), and <a href="/Qing_Dynasty" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing</a> (<a href="/Manchu" title="Manchu">Manchu</a>). Each time, they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="A_new_age">A new age</span></h3>
<p>While China achieved many things in the <a href="/First_millennium" title="First millennium">First millennium</a> and early <a href="/2nd_millennium" title="2nd millennium">2nd millennium</a>, it became an <a href="/Isolationism" title="Isolationism">isolationist</a> country in the <a href="/15th_century" title="15th century">15th century C.E.</a> This was because Spain found a lot of silver in the newly explored <a href="/Continent" title="Continent">continents</a> of <a href="/Americas" title="Americas">North and South America</a>. Silver was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.</p>
<p>By the time of the <a href="/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over by Europeans, many <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> <a href="/Countries" title="Countries">countries</a>, such as <a href="/Britain" title="Britain">Britain</a> and <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> built <a href="/Spheres_of_influence" title="Spheres of influence">spheres of influence</a> in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few <a href="/Centuries" title="Centuries">centuries</a>, by the <a href="/Qing_Dynasty" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>, it had fallen behind other countries in <a href="/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a>, and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the <a href="/Opium_Wars" title="Opium Wars">Opium Wars</a> to <a href="/Britain" title="Britain">Britain</a> in the <a href="/19th_century" title="19th century">19th century</a>.</p>
<p>In 1912, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by the <a href="/Sun_Yat-sen" title="Sun Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a> and the <a href="/Kuomintang" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a>, a <a href="/Nationalist" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> party, and the <a href="/Republic_of_China" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> established. Over time, <a href="/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> ideas grew popular and the <a href="/Communist_Party_of_China" title="Communist Party of China">Communist party</a> was formed.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Chinese_Civil_War" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a> later started between the <a href="/Kuomintang" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> (Nationalists) of the <a href="/Republic_of_China" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by <a href="/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, <a href="/Liu_Shaoqi" title="Liu Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a> and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.</p>
<p>In 1927, the <a href="/Chinese_Civil_War" title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a> began as the Kuomintang, led by <a href="/Chiang_Kai-shek" title="Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, and the Communists fought one another. By 1949, the <a href="/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> of the Chinese Communist Party had gained control over <a href="/Mainland_China" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a> and <a href="/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> announced the creation of the People's Republic of China. <a href="/Chiang_Kai-shek" title="Chiang Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> and the other nationalists fled to <a href="/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>.</p>


<p>As the leader of the People's Republic of China, Mao began many social and economic reform projects with mixed results. The <a href="/Great_Leap_Forward" title="Great Leap Forward">Great Leap Forward</a>, from 1958 to 1961, tried to <a href="/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialize</a> China and increase its food production, but resulted in one of the largest <a href="/Famine" title="Famine">famines</a> in history. It is estimated that 45 million people died as a result of this reform project.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Akbar2010"><a href="#_note-Akbar2010" title="">[15]</a></sup> In 1966, Mao began the <a href="/Cultural_Revolution" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> to remove <a href="/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> influences from society and government. Major government officials and ordinary citizens were accused of being "revisionists" - people who disagreed with some parts of Marxism - or "counter-revolutionaries" and were <a href="/Persecution" title="Persecution">persecuted</a>. Many universities and schools were closed, and historical and religious sites were destroyed. Although the program officially ended in 1969, it continued until Mao's death in 1976.</p>
<p>During this time period, the People's Republic of China did not get along with the <a href="/Capitalist" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> countries of the <a href="/Western_world" title="Western world">Western world</a>. Beginning in the 1960s, relationships between the People's Republic of China and the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> also became increasingly unfriendly in the <a href="/Sino-Soviet_Split" title="Sino-Soviet Split">Sino-Soviet Split</a>. In 1972, to counter the power of the Soviet Union, Mao and <a href="/Zhou_Enlai" title="Zhou Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a> met with US President <a href="/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in Beijing. This began to improve relationships between China and the Western world.</p>
<p>After Mao's death, there was a power struggle between the <a href="/Gang_of_Four" title="Gang of Four">Gang of Four</a> and <a href="/Hua_Guofeng" title="Hua Guofeng">Hua Guofeng</a>, the man Mao had chosen to be the next leader of China. Eventually, <a href="/Deng_Xiaoping" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>, one of the <a href="/Veteran" title="Veteran">veterans</a> of the revolution, took power. He began a "Reform and Opening Up" ({{zh|s=改革开放|t=改革開放}}) campaign. These reforms tried to make the People's Republic of China a modern, industrial - but still socialist - nation by moving towards a <a href="/Market_economy" title="Market economy">market system</a>. Deng's policies would be known as "socialism with Chinese characteristics."</p>
<p>Although Deng's policy helped loosen restrictions on citizens, the People's Republic of China continues to have problems with the amount of control the government has over citizens' private lives. In 1979, the <a href="/One-child_policy" title="One-child policy">one-child policy</a>, which limits most couples to one child, was created because of the <a href="/Overpopulation" title="Overpopulation">overpopulation</a> problem in the People's Republic of China. This policy is highly <a href="/Controversy" title="Controversy">controversial</a> and many Westerners have criticized it. News and Internet sites are also <a href="/Censorship" title="Censorship">censored</a> by the government.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Festivals">Festivals</span></h3>
<p>Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year. It lasts fifteen days. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. On the first day of the Spring Festival, people call on friends and relatives. Because most of people watch the Spring Festival Celebrations on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00 AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Spring Festival is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:财神爷), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:饺子). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck.The last day of the Spring Festival is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:汤圆,元宵), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.</p>
<p>Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the <a href="/Warring_States" title="Warring States">Warring States</a> period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.</p>
<p>Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the "moon cakes." Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.</p>
