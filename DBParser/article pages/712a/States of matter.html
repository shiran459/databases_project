<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Common_states_of_matter">Common states of matter</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Solids">Solids</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Solid}}
In a <i>solid</i>, the positions of atoms are fixed relative to each other over long time. That is due to the <a href="/Cohesion_(chemistry)" title="Cohesion (chemistry)">cohesion</a> or "friction" between <a href="/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a>. This cohesion is provided by <a href="/Metallic_bond" title="Metallic bond">metallic</a>, <a href="/Covalent_bond" title="Covalent bond">covalent</a> or <a href="/Ionic_bond" title="Ionic bond">ionic</a> <a href="/Chemical_bond" title="Chemical bond">bonds</a>. Only solids can be pushed on by a force without changing shape, which means that they can be resistant to <a href="/Deformation" title="Deformation">deformation</a>. Solids also tend to be strong enough to hold their own shape in a container. Solids are generally denser than liquids. Solid becoming  a gas is sublimation.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Liquids">Liquids</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Liquid}}
In a <i>liquid</i>, molecules are attracted to each other strongly enough to keep them in contact, but not strongly enough to hold a particular structure. The molecules can continually move with respect to each other. This means that liquids can flow smoothly, but not as smoothly as gases. Liquids will tend to take the shape of a container that they are in. Liquids are generally less dense than solids, but denser than gases.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gases">Gases</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Gas}}
In a <i>gas</i>, the chemical bonds are not strong enough to hold atoms or molecules together, and from this a gas is a collection of independent, unbonded molecules which interact mainly by <a href="/Collision" title="Collision">collision</a>. Gases tend to take the shape of their container, and are less dense than both solids and liquids.
Gases have weaker forces of attraction than solids and liquids. Gas becoming a solid directly is deposition.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Plasmas">Plasmas</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Plasma (physics)}}
<i>Plasmas</i> are gases that have so much <a href="/Kinetic_energy" title="Kinetic energy">energy</a> that <a href="/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a> of an atom cannot stay in <a href="/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbit</a> around one <a href="/Atomic_nucleus" title="Atomic nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>. The atomic <a href="/Ion" title="Ion">ions</a> and free electrons mix around like a hot soup. </p>
<p>Because the positive and negative <a href="/Electric_charge" title="Electric charge">charged</a> particles are not stuck together, plasma is a good <a href="/Conduction" title="Conduction">conductor</a> of <a href="/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>. For example, air is not good at conducting electricity. However, in a bolt of <a href="/Lightning" title="Lightning">lightning</a>, the atoms in air get so much energy that they no longer can hold on to their electrons, and become a plasma for a brief time. Then an <a href="/Electric_current" title="Electric current">electric current</a> is able to flow through the plasma, making the lightning.</p>
<p>Plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe. Both <a href="/Stars" title="Stars">stars</a> and the <a href="/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar medium">interstellar medium</a> are mostly made of plasma.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Phase_changes">Phase changes</span></h2>
<p>Phases of matter can be changed by a number of things. This includes <a href="/Pressure" title="Pressure">pressure</a> and <a href="/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a>.</p>
<p>When a solid becomes a liquid, it is called <a href="/Melt" title="Melt">melting</a>. When a solid becomes a gas, it is called <a href="/Sublimation" title="Sublimation">sublimation</a>. When a liquid becomes a gas, it is called <a href="/Evaporation" title="Evaporation">evaporation</a>. When a gas becomes a liquid, it is called <a href="/Condensation" title="Condensation">condensation</a>. When a liquid becomes a solid, it is called <a href="/Freezing" title="Freezing">freezing</a>. The freezing point and the melting point are said to be the same, because any increase in temperature will cause it to melt and any drop in temperature will cause it to freeze. This is also the reason that the vaporizing and condensation point are the same.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_states">Other states</span></h2>
<p>Many other states of matter can exist under special conditions, including <a href="/Strange_matter" title="Strange matter">strange matter</a>, <a href="/Supersolids" title="Supersolids">supersolids</a>, and possibly <a href="/String-net_liquid" title="String-net liquid">string-net liquids</a>. Scientist work on experiments at very high or very low temperatures to learn more about phases of matter.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supercritical_fluids">Supercritical fluids</span></h3>
<p>When a substance reaches a high enough temperature and pressure at the same time, called the <a href="/Critical_point_(thermodynamics)" title="Critical point (thermodynamics)">critical point</a>, you can't tell the  difference between very dense gas and very energetic liquid. This is supercritical fluid, and it behaves like both liquid and gas.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Superfluids">Superfluids</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Superfluidity" title="Superfluidity">Superfluids</a>, on the other hand, only happen at very low temperatures, and only for a few special substances like liquid <a href="/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>. Superfluids can do things that regular liquids cannot, like flowing up the side of a bowl and getting out.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bose-Einstein_condensates">Bose-Einstein condensates</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Bose_Einstein_Condensation" title="Bose Einstein Condensation">Bose-Einstein condensates</a> and <a href="/Fermionic_condensate" title="Fermionic condensate">fermionic condensates</a> are phases of matter that apply to <a href="/Particle" title="Particle">particles</a> called <a href="/Boson" title="Boson">bosons</a> and <a href="/Fermion" title="Fermion">fermions</a>, respectively. (More than one boson can exist in the same spot at the same time. Only one fermion can exist in the same spot at the same time). Bose-Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates occur at incredibly low temperatures (about 4° Kelvin, which is the same as -452° Fahrenheit). All of the particles in these condensates begin to act like one big <a href="/Quantum_state" title="Quantum state">quantum state</a>, so they have almost no <a href="/Friction" title="Friction">friction</a> or <a href="/Electrical_resistance" title="Electrical resistance">electrical resistance</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Degenerate_matter">Degenerate matter</span></h3>
<p>When the core of a <a href="/Star" title="Star">star</a> runs out of light elements (like hydrogen or helium) to sustain <a href="/Fusion" title="Fusion">fusion</a>, the core will collapse into a very dense state called <i>degenerate matter</i>. Everything is packed very tightly and can barely move. If the star isn't too heavy, it becomes a <a href="/White_dwarf" title="White dwarf">white dwarf</a>. In a heavier star, the pressure is so intense that even the <a href="/Protons" title="Protons">protons</a> and <a href="/Electrons" title="Electrons">electrons</a> are crushed, and it becomes a <a href="/Neutron_star" title="Neutron star">neutron star</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Quark-gluon_plasmas">Quark-gluon plasmas</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/Proton" title="Proton">protons</a> and <a href="/Neutron" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> that make up atoms are made of even smaller things called <a href="/Quark" title="Quark">quarks</a> (which are "glued" together by things called "<a href="/Gluons" title="Gluons">gluons</a>"). At incredibly high temperatures over 2 trillion <a href="/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">Kelvin</a>, quarks and gluons turn into another state of matter. Humans can make a little bit of quark-gluon plasma in the <a href="/Large_Hadron_Collider" title="Large Hadron Collider">Large Hadron Collider</a> at <a href="/CERN" title="CERN">CERN</a>, but it doesn't last long before cooling down.</p>
