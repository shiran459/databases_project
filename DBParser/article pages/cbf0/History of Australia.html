<p>People have lived in <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> for about 40,000–60,000 years. The first people who arrived in what is now Australia were the Aboriginal people and <a href="/Torres_Strait_Islanders" title="Torres Strait Islanders">Torres Strait Islanders</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-dfat.gov.au"><a href="#_note-dfat.gov.au" title="">[1]</a></sup> The aboriginal people  came by <a href="/Boat" title="Boat">boat</a> from the <a href="/Island" title="Island">islands</a> of <a href="/History_of_Indonesia" title="History of Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. They lived in all parts of Australia. Their lives were simple, they had very few needs. They lived by <a href="/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a>, <a href="/Fishing" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and gathering.</p>
<p>Aborigines invented tools like the <a href="/Boomerang" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a> and spear, but did not farm. Tradition was very important in their lives. Their religion is called the <a href="/Dreaming_(spirituality)" title="Dreaming (spirituality)">Dreaming</a>, which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits. <a href="/Aboriginal_art" title="Aboriginal art">Aboriginal art</a> started at least 30,000 years ago and there are lots of Dreaming stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around Australia. <a href="/Australian_Aboriginal_music" title="Australian Aboriginal music">Aboriginal music</a> has songs about the Dreamtime, sometimes with special instruments like the <a href="/Didgeridoo" title="Didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a>.</p>
<p>In 1606 the first European, <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> explorer <a href="/Willem_Janszoon" title="Willem Janszoon">Willem Janszoon</a> (1571–1639), visited the west. Luis Vaez <a href="/Luis_Vaez_de_Torres" title="Luis Vaez de Torres">de Torres</a> sailed through the water between Australia and <a href="/Papua_New_Guinea" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> later that year.{{fact|date=November 2014}} 
Only after Dirk Hartog chanced upon the west coast in 1616 did other European vessels visit and map the coast. After sixty more ships visited the coast,{{fact|date=November 2014}} enough was known for a map to be published in 1811.  The land was dry because of not much rain; some was a <a href="/Desert" title="Desert">desert</a>. The explorers thought no <a href="/Crop" title="Crop">crops</a> could be grown and so it would be difficult for people to live there. They decided there would be no <a href="/Economic" title="Economic">economic</a> reasons to stay. </p>
<p>In 1642, Dutchman <a href="/Abel_Tasman" title="Abel Tasman">Abel Tasman</a>, working for the <a href="/Dutch_East_Indies_Company" title="Dutch East Indies Company">Dutch East Indies Company</a> reached <a href="/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, which he called <a href="/Antony_van_Diemenslandt" title="Antony van Diemenslandt">Antony van Diemenslandt</a>. He then called the continent he charted the north coast of on his second visit in 1644 <a href="/New_Holland" title="New Holland">New Holland</a>. In 1688, <a href="/William_Dampier" title="William Dampier">William Dampier</a> became the first <b>Englishman</b> to reach Australia. But in 1770 a British sailor, Captain <a href="/James_Cook" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>, found the fertile east coast of Australia. He called it <a href="/New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>, and claimed it for Britain.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-dfat.gov.au_b"><a href="#_note-dfat.gov.au" title="">[1]</a></sup>
Englishman <a href="/Matthew_Flinders" title="Matthew Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> published his map of the coast in 1814, calling it <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> for the first time, a name later formally adopted by the authorities.</p>

<p>The British decided to use the land visited by <a href="/Captain_Cook" title="Captain Cook">Captain Cook</a> as a prison colony. Britain needed a place to send its <a href="/Convict" title="Convict">convicts</a> (people who had been sent to <a href="/Jail" title="Jail">jail</a> for <a href="/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a> and other <a href="/Crime" title="Crime">crimes</a>) because its <a href="/Gaol" title="Gaol">gaols</a> were full and it had just lost its American colonies in the <a href="/American_War_of_Independence" title="American War of Independence">American War of Independence</a>. In 1788 the British <a href="/First_Fleet" title="First Fleet">First Fleet</a> of 11 ships, carrying about 1500 people arrived at Botany Bay (Sydney). <a href="/Arthur_Phillip" title="Arthur Phillip">Arthur Phillip</a> led them as the first <a href="/Governor_of_New_South_Wales" title="Governor of New South Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>. About 160 000 convicts were brought to Australia from 1788 until 1868. Free immigrants began arriving in the 1790s.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-dfat.gov.au_c"><a href="#_note-dfat.gov.au" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the first few years they did not have much <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a>, and life was very hard. But soon they began to <a href="/Farm" title="Farm">farm</a>, and more people came. Sydney grew, and new towns were started. <a href="/Wool" title="Wool">Wool</a> brought good money. By 1822, many towns had been set up and people from the towns often visited Sydney for additional economic resources.</p>
<p>Soon people from <a href="/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> found other parts of Australia. <a href="/George_Bass" title="George Bass">George Bass</a> and <a href="/Matthew_Flinders" title="Matthew Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> sailed south to <a href="/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and a colony was started at <a href="/Hobart" title="Hobart">Hobart</a> in 1803. <a href="/Hamilton_Hume" title="Hamilton Hume">Hamilton Hume</a> and <a href="/William_Hovell" title="William Hovell">William Hovell</a> went south from Sydney by land. They found the <a href="/Murray_River" title="Murray River">Murray River</a>, and good land in <a href="/Victoria_(Australia)" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>. <a href="/Thomas_Mitchell" title="Thomas Mitchell">Thomas Mitchell</a> went inland, and found more rivers. In 1826, the first <a href="/British_military" title="British military">British military</a> outpost was set up at <a href="/King_George_Sound" title="King George Sound">King George Sound</a> in <a href="/Western_Australia" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a>. The <a href="/Swan_River_Colony" title="Swan River Colony">Swan River Colony</a> was started in 1829, with townsites at <a href="/Fremantle%2C_Western_Australia" title="Fremantle, Western Australia">Fremantle</a> and <a href="/Perth%2C_Western_Australia" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a>. In 1836, a free-settler colony was started in <a href="/South_Australia" title="South Australia">South Australia</a>, where no convicts were ever sent. <a href="/Queensland" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> became a separate colony in 1859. As the towns and farms spread across Australia, the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land. Some were <a href="/Kill" title="Kill">killed</a>, and many <a href="/Die" title="Die">died</a> from <a href="/Disease" title="Disease">illness</a> and hunger. Soon, Australia's Aborigines were outnumbered by Europeans, and many were made to live on reserves.</p>
<p>The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich.</p>
<p>Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and self-govern. The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. The <a href="/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council" title="New South Wales Legislative Council">New South Wales Legislative Council</a>, was created in 1825 to advise the <a href="/Governor_of_New_South_Wales" title="Governor of New South Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>, but it was not chosen by voters. <a href="/William_Wentworth" title="William Wentworth">William Wentworth</a> established the <a href="/Australian_Patriotic_Association" title="Australian Patriotic Association">Australian Patriotic Association</a> (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand <a href="/Parliamentary_democracy" title="Parliamentary democracy">democratic government</a> for New South Wales. In 1840, the <a href="/Adelaide_City_Council" title="Adelaide City Council">Adelaide City Council</a> and the <a href="/Sydney_City_Council" title="Sydney City Council">Sydney City Council</a> were started and some people could vote for them (but only men with a certain amount of money). Then, Australia's first <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">parliamentary</a> elections were held for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. <i>The Australian Colonies Government Act</i> [1850] allowed constitutions for New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1850 elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-autogenerated1"><a href="#_note-autogenerated1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1855, limited self government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. A new <a href="/Secret_ballot" title="Secret ballot">secret ballot</a> was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, allowing people to vote in private. This system was copied around the world. In 1855, the <a href="/Right_to_vote" title="Right to vote">right to vote</a> was given to all men over 21 in <a href="/South_Australia" title="South Australia">South Australia</a>. The other colonies soon followed.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-autogenerated1_b"><a href="#_note-autogenerated1" title="">[3]</a></sup> Women were given the vote in the <a href="/Parliament_of_South_Australia" title="Parliament of South Australia">Parliament of South Australia</a> in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections. In 1897, <a href="/Catherine_Helen_Spence" title="Catherine Helen Spence">Catherine Helen Spence</a> became the first female political candidate.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-aec.gov.au"><a href="#_note-aec.gov.au" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.</p>
