<p>An <b>uncle</b> is a name used in an extended <a href="/Family" title="Family">family</a>. An uncle is either a <a href="/Brother" title="Brother">brother</a> of one of someone's <a href="/Parent" title="Parent">parents</a> or the <a href="/Husband" title="Husband">husband</a> of their <a href="/Aunt" title="Aunt">aunt</a>. That person is the uncle's <a href="/Nephew" title="Nephew">nephew</a> (<a href="/Male" title="Male">male</a>) or <a href="/Niece" title="Niece">niece</a> (<a href="/Female" title="Female">female</a>). An uncle's <a href="/Child" title="Child">child</a> is a <a href="/Cousin" title="Cousin">cousin</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Utah179"><a href="#_note-Utah179" title="">[1]</a></sup> A <a href="/En:wikt:granduncle" title="En:wikt:granduncle">granduncle</a> (also written as great-uncle or grand-uncle) is the brother or <a href="/Brother-in-law" title="Brother-in-law">brother-in-law</a> of a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grandparent">grandparent</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Utah179_b"><a href="#_note-Utah179" title="">[1]</a></sup> In some cultures an uncle is considered a close family member. Based on the old <a href="/China" title="China">Chinese</a> saying "the oldest son in the family is the father of the family" an uncle is often the head of a family.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In many cultures no single word (such as uncle) describes both their parents' brothers. Instead there are words to describe a person's kinship to their mother's brother or a person's kinship to their father's brother. An uncle can also be someone not related by blood or marriage as in a term of <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/endearment">endearment</a> or respect. In this use uncle can also be part of a nickname such as <a href="/Uncle_Sam" title="Uncle Sam">Uncle Sam</a>. </p>
