<p><b>Percent</b> means <i>out of one hundred</i>.  It is often shown with the symbol "%". It is used even if there are not a hundred items.  The number is then scaled so it can be compared to one hundred.  </p>
<p>Percentages are one way of writing numbers; you can also write percentages as fractions or decimals.  </p>
<p>For example, I have a bowl of fruit with three apples and one orange. The percentage of apples is 3 out of 4 = 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%.</p>
