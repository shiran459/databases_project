<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_origin_of_cheese">The origin of cheese</span></h2>
<p>People have been making cheese since before <a href="/History" title="History">history</a> was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made. It is known that cheese was eaten by the <a href="/Sumerians" title="Sumerians">Sumerians</a> in about 4000 BC.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_cheese_is_made">How cheese is made</span></h2>
<p>Cheese is made using milk. The milk of <a href="/Cow" title="Cow">cows</a>, <a href="/Goat" title="Goat">goats</a>, and <a href="/Sheep" title="Sheep">sheep</a> are most popular. <a href="/Buffalo" title="Buffalo">Buffalo</a>, <a href="/Camel" title="Camel">camel</a>, <a href="/Donkey" title="Donkey">donkey</a> and even <a href="/Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> milk can also be used. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large <a href="/Pot" title="Pot">pots</a>. They add <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a> and a <a href="/Substance" title="Substance">substance</a> from the <a href="/Stomach" title="Stomach">stomach</a> of young cows called <a href="/Rennet" title="Rennet">rennet</a>. This curdles the cheese and makes it solid. Some makers do not add <a href="/Rennet" title="Rennet">rennet</a>. They curdle the cheese in other ways. Cheese made in <a href="/Factory" title="Factory">factories</a> is often curdled by using bacteria. Other <a href="/Ingredients" title="Ingredients">ingredients</a> are added and the cheese is usually aged for a varied length of time.</p>
