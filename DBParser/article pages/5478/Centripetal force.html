<p><b>Centripetal force</b> (or acceleration) is a type of <a href="/Force_(physics)" title="Force (physics)">force</a> that acts on any body that revolves around a centre. This force contributes to keeping the body in circular motion. This force is always directed towards the centre.</p>
<p>The opposite force (by <a href="/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s third law of motion) is called <a href="/Centrifugal_force" title="Centrifugal force">centrifugal force</a>. This is the force that acts on the body in a direction away from the centre, which contributes to making the body try to fly away. When you hold a rope with a heavy object attached to it, and rotate it around, the rope becomes tight and keeps the body from flying away. This is caused by centripetal force.
An example is a roller coaster which uses centripetal force to keep the carts going in a circular motion.</p>
