<p>A <b>conceptual metaphor</b> or <b>cognitive metaphor</b> is a <a href="/Metaphor" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a> which refers to one domain (group of ideas) in terms of another. For example, treating <a href="/Quantity" title="Quantity">quantity</a> in terms of <a href="/Direction" title="Direction">direction</a>:
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Prices are rising</i>.</li>
<li><i>I attacked every weak point in his argument</i>. (Argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth).</li>
<li><i>Life is a journey</i>.</li>
<li><i>Love</i> talked about as if it were <i>war</i> or <i>competition</i>.</li>
<li><i>Time</i> talked about as if it were a <i>path through space</i>, or a <i>quantity</i> that can be saved or spent or wasted.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980: <i>Metaphors we live by</i>.

<dd>"The most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought". Donald Freeman.</dd>
