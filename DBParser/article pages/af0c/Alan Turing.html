<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Young_Life_and_Family">Young Life and Family</span></h2>
<p>Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father was part of a family of <a href="/Merchant" title="Merchant">merchants</a> from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the <a href="/Daughter" title="Daughter">daughter</a> of an <a href="/Engineer" title="Engineer">engineer</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h3>
<p>Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was six years old.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
<p>Turing was one of the people who worked on the first <a href="/Computers" title="Computers">computers</a>. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the <a href="/Turing_machine" title="Turing machine">Turing machine</a> in 1936. The machine was <a href="/Imagination" title="Imagination">imaginary</a>, but it included the idea of a <a href="/Computer_program" title="Computer program">computer program</a>. </p>
<p>Turing was interested in <a href="/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. He proposed the <a href="/Turing_test" title="Turing test">Turing test</a>, to say when a machine could be called "<a href="/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligent</a>". A computer could be said to "think" if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>During <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Turing worked to break <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> <a href="/Cipher" title="Cipher">ciphers</a> (secret messages). Using <a href="/Cryptanalysis" title="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a>, he helped to break the codes of the <a href="/Enigma_(machine)" title="Enigma (machine)">Enigma</a> machine. After that, he solved other German codes.</p>
<p>From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the <a href="/ACE_(computer)" title="ACE (computer)">ACE</a> (Automatic Computing Engine) at the <a href="/National_Physical_Laboratory" title="National Physical Laboratory">National Physical Laboratory</a>. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was "the first detailed design of a <a href="/Stored-program_computer" title="Stored-program computer">stored-program computer</a>".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the <a href="/Pilot_ACE" title="Pilot ACE">Pilot ACE</a> was built without him. It ran its first program on 10 May 1950.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Private_life">Private life</span></h2>
<p>Turing was a <a href="/Homosexual" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. At that time, <a href="/Homosexual" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> acts were illegal. Turing was <a href="/Conviction" title="Conviction">convicted</a>. He had to choose between going to <a href="/Jail" title="Jail">jail</a> and taking <a href="/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormones</a> to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> After his punishment, he became <a href="/Erectile_dysfunction" title="Erectile dysfunction">impotent</a>. He also grew <a href="/Breast" title="Breast">breasts</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May 2012, a <a href="/Private_member's_bill" title="Private member's bill">private member's bill</a> was put before the <a href="/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> to grant Turing a statutory <a href="/Pardon" title="Pardon">pardon</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Guardian-Pardon"><a href="#_note-Guardian-Pardon" title="">[6]</a></sup> In July 2013, the government supported it.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-turingguardian19july2013"><a href="#_note-turingguardian19july2013" title="">[7]</a></sup> A royal pardon was granted on 24 December 2013.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-turingindependent24dec2013"><a href="#_note-turingindependent24dec2013" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-turingpardoncryptome24dec2013"><a href="#_note-turingpardoncryptome24dec2013" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Death">Death</span></h2>
<p>In 1954, after suffering for two years, Turing died from <a href="/Cyanide" title="Cyanide">cyanide</a> poisoning. The cyanide came from either an <a href="/Apple" title="Apple">apple</a> which was poisoned with <a href="/Cyanide" title="Cyanide">cyanide</a>, or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>It is also suspected that he committed suicide. </p>
<p>The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against <a href="/Medical_ethics" title="Medical ethics">medical ethics</a> and international laws of <a href="/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. In August 2009, a <a href="/Petition" title="Petition">petition</a> asking the <a href="/British_Government" title="British Government">British Government</a> to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The petition received thousands of signatures.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> <a href="/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/Gordon_Brown" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a> acknowledged the petition. He called Turing's treatment "appalling".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-14"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
