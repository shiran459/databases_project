<p>A <b>city</b> is a place where many people live together. </p>
<p>A city has many <a href="/Building" title="Building">buildings</a> and <a href="/Street" title="Street">streets</a>. It has houses or apartments for many people to live, shops where they may buy things, places for people to work and a <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> <a href="/Organisation" title="Organisation">organisation</a> to run the city, and to keep <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a> and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/order">order</a> in the city. People live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there. A city usually has a "city centre" where government and <a href="/Business" title="Business">business</a> take place, and places called <a href="/Suburb" title="Suburb">suburbs</a> where people live around the outside of the centre.</p>

<p>
There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called "city" and other places are called "town". </p>
<p>Some things that make a city are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>A long <a href="/History" title="History">history</a>. Although many cities today have only been around for tens or hundreds of years, there are a few which have been so for thousands of years. For example, <a href="/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> was founded in 1000 <a href="/BC" title="BC">BC</a> and <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> has existed since 700 BC.</li>
<li>A large <a href="/Population" title="Population">population</a>. Cities can have millions of people living in and around them. Among them is <a href="/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and the <a href="/Tokyo_Metropolis" title="Tokyo Metropolis">Tokyo Metropolis</a> around it, which includes <a href="/Yokohama" title="Yokohama">Yokohama</a> and <a href="/Chiba%2C_Chiba" title="Chiba, Chiba">Chiba</a>.</li>
<li>A centre where <a href="/Business" title="Business">business</a> and <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> takes place. The first case is often described as the <a href="/Financial_capital" title="Financial capital">financial capital</a>, such as <a href="/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> in <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>. The second case is true for different levels of government, whether they are <a href="/Local_government" title="Local government">local</a> or part of a larger <a href="/Region" title="Region">region</a> (for example, <a href="/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="/Georgia_(state)" title="Georgia (state)">Georgia</a>, or an entire <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a> (for example, <a href="/Washington%2C_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>). Cities which contain the government of the region it is in are called <a href="/Capital_city" title="Capital city">capitals</a>. Almost every country has <a href="/List_of_national_capitals" title="List of national capitals">its own capital</a>.</li>
<li>Special powers called <a href="/Town_privileges" title="Town privileges">town privileges</a> which have been given by the government of the <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a>, or its ruler. This was done especially in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> during the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</li>
<li>Having a cathedral or a <a href="/University" title="University">university</a>. This rule is found in the United Kingdom. The smallest "cathedral cities" are <a href="/St._David's" title="St. David's">St. David's</a> and <a href="/St_Asaph's" title="St Asaph's">St Asaph's</a> which are both in <a href="/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and <a href="/Ripon" title="Ripon">Ripon</a> and <a href="/Wells" title="Wells">Wells</a> which are in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>In American English, people often call all places where many people live cities.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> (See below: Size of cities)</p>

<p>
The sizes of cities can be very different. This depends on the type of city that it is. Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much, are very much smaller than modern cities. There are two main reasons. One reason is that old cities often have a city wall, and most of the city is inside it. Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow. If the city got too big, it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the <a href="/Market_place" title="Market place">market place</a>. People in cities need food, and the food always has to come from outside the city. Cities that were on a river like <a href="/London" title="London">London</a> could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like <a href="/Sienna" title="Sienna">Sienna</a> in <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, because the river made a <a href="/Transport" title="Transport">transport</a> route for carrying food and other <a href="/Goods" title="Goods">goods</a>, as well as for transporting people. London has been changing continually for hundreds of years, while Siena, which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years. Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large, because the streets are wide enough for cars, buses and trucks, and there are often railway lines as well.</p>
<p>In the US, the word city is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America, they gave the name "city" to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city. </p>
<p>In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger. The whole area is often called a <i>"<a href="/Metropolis" title="Metropolis">metropolis</a>"</i> and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages. The <i>metropolis</i> of London includes the City of London, the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill, Southwark, Richmond, Greenwich and etc. The part that is officially known as the "City of London" only takes up one square mile. The rest is known as "Greater London". Many other cities have grown in the same way. </p>
<p>These giant cities can be exciting places to live, and many people can find good jobs there, but modern cities also have many problems. Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> by <a href="/Beggar" title="Beggar">begging</a> or by <a href="/Crime" title="Crime">crime</a>. <a href="/Car" title="Car">Cars</a>, factories, and <a href="/Garbage" title="Garbage">waste</a> create a lot of <a href="/Pollution" title="Pollution">pollution</a> that makes people sick. the smallest city is Urban history</p>


<p> </p>
<p><a href="/Urban" title="Urban">Urban</a> History is history of <a href="/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilization</a>. The first cities were made in ancient times, as soon as people began to create <a href="/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilization</a>. Famous ancient cities which fell to <a href="/Ruins" title="Ruins">ruins</a> included <a href="/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>, <a href="/Troy" title="Troy">Troy</a>, <a href="/Mycenae" title="Mycenae">Mycenae</a> and Mohenjo Daro.</p>
<p><a href="/Benares" title="Benares">Benares</a> in northern <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years. Other cities that have existed since ancient times are <a href="/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> in <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="/Volterra" title="Volterra">Volterra</a> in <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="/York" title="York">York</a> in England.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, in the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, being a city was a special <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/privilege">privilege</a>, granted by <a href="/Nobility" title="Nobility">nobility</a>. Cities that fall into this category, usually had (or still have) city walls. The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not. Medieval cities that still have walls include <a href="/Carcassonne" title="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a> in <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/Tehran" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> in <a href="/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/Toledo%2C_Spain" title="Toledo, Spain">Toledo</a> in <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="/Canterbury" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, a city is a town which people have always called a city, or which has got the name "city" status by royal charter (a special paper from the king or queen). Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important. In the past, cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university. Some cathedral cities, for example St David's, are small, and people do not normally think of them as cities. Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges. The university cities of <a href="/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="/Cambridge" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> are famous throughout the world. The largest city is Shanghai, while the fastest growing is <a href="/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>. The smallest city in the UK is <a href="/Wells" title="Wells">Wells</a>.</p>
