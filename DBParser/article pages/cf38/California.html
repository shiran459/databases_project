<p>The geography of California varies depending on region. Southwestern California has small mountain ranges and the cities of Sandy Hey Go and Los Angeles. Southeastern California has desert and <a href="/Death_Valley" title="Death Valley">Death Valley</a>, the lowest place in the United States. The eastern part of the state has the highest point in the United States outside of Alaska, <a href="/Mount_Whitney" title="Mount Whitney">Mount Whitney</a>, in the <a href="/Sierra_Nevada" title="Sierra Nevada">Sierra Nevada</a> mountain range.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>

<p>The state is a leader in three businesses: <a href="/Farming" title="Farming">farming</a>, movie-making, and high technology, mostly <a href="/Software" title="Software">software</a> and Web sites.  Aerospace used to be a large industry there, but it has been downsized in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>There are many <a href="/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> in California. They happen when two earth crusts shift underground. Californians need to be prepared for earthquakes and often store extra food, water, flashlights, and first aid supplies in case of such an emergency.</p>
<p>California has more people than any other state in the United States. If California was a separate country, it would have the sixth largest <a href="/Economics" title="Economics">economy</a> in the world. California is probably the state with the most ethnic groups. It also has many different geographic features — mountains, deserts, and coasts. It is often called <i>The Golden State</i>. The state flower is the golden poppy. The <a href="/Post_office" title="Post office">post office</a> uses "CA" as a shorthand for California, and the <a href="/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> uses "Calif." or "Cali."</p>

<p>California is a big power in American culture as well as the business life of the nation. Many of the great changes in technology and law came from California, and the state pays more to the U.S. government than it gets back. It also has some of the country's largest cities, such as <a href="/Los_Angeles%2C_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="/San_Diego%2C_California" title="San Diego, California">San Diego</a>, <a href="/San_Jose%2C_California" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a>, and <a href="/San_Francisco%2C_California" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>In the past, the area that was called "California" was not just today's California. This area covered the <a href="/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> lands south of it, as well as <a href="/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, and parts of Arizona and <a href="/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. The Spanish called the part of the land that later became part of the United States <i>Alta California</i> (Upper California) when it was split from what became <i>Baja California</i> (Lower California). In these early times, the borders of the <a href="/Sea_of_Cortez" title="Sea of Cortez">Sea of Cortez</a> and the Pacific coast were not well known, so the old maps wrongly showed California to be an island. The name comes from <i>Las sergas de Espladián</i> (Adventures of Spladian), a <a href="/16th_century" title="16th century">16th century</a> book by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, where there is an island paradise called California.</p>
<p>The first <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> who visited parts of the coast, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, came from <a href="/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> in 1542. The first European who saw the entire coast was Sir Francis Drake, in 1579, and he decided that the <a href="/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">British</a> owned it. But starting in the late 1700s, <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> religious leaders of the <a href="/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> ("missionaries") got large gifts of land in the area north of Baja California, from the Spanish king and queen. These religious people set up small towns and villages, the famous California Missions. When Mexico was no longer controlled by Spain, the Mexican government took over the villages, and they soon became empty.

<p>
In 1846, as the <a href="/Mexican-American_War" title="Mexican-American War">Mexican-American War</a> was starting, some Americans in California hoped to create a California <a href="/Republic" title="Republic">Republic</a>. These men flew a "Bear flag" that had a golden bear with a <a href="/Star" title="Star">star</a> on it. This Republic ended suddenly, however, when Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States <a href="/Navy" title="Navy">Navy</a> sailed into <a href="/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. He said that California was now part of the United States. After the war with Mexico ended, California was split between the two countries. The Mexican portion became the Mexican states of Baja California Norte (north) and Baja California Sur (south). ("Baja" means "lower" in Spanish.) The western part of the part given to the United States became today's state of California.</p>
<p>In 1848, there were about 4,000 Spanish-speaking people in today's California on the American side. (Today the state has a total of nearly 40,000,000 people.) In 1849, gold was suddenly found and the number of people went up very fast as the <a href="/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">Gold Rush</a> took hold. In 1850, California became a state in the Union (the United States).</p>
<p>During the <a href="/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> (1861-1865), many people in California, especially in the southern part of California, thought the South was right. Some people in Southern California even wanted Southern California to leave the rest of the state and join the <a href="/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate States of America</a>. However, this did not happen. California joined the war to and helped the North (the Union) and sent many troops east to fight the <a href="/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>At first, travel between the far west and the east coast of the United States was dangerous and took a lot of time. Going by land was very difficult, because there were no roads and no trains, and many <a href="/Native_American" title="Native American">Native Americans</a> were attacking American people heading West in wagons. The only other way was to travel by boat around the <a href="/Cape_Horn" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a>, at the southern end of <a href="/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>. This took months, since the trip was thousands of miles long and the <a href="/Panama_Canal" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a> had not yet been built either. But in 1869, the connection got better quickly, because the first <a href="/Railroad" title="Railroad">railroad</a> across the continent was finished. Meanwhile, more people in California were learning that the land there was very good to grow fruit and other crops. <a href="/Orange_(fruit)" title="Orange (fruit)">Oranges</a> were grown in many parts of California. This was the beginning of the huge farming business that California has today.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Present_day">Present day</span></h2>
<p>In 1900, there were only a million people in California and 105,000 in Los Angeles. Today, California has more people than any other U.S. state. Starting in 1965, the variety of people became much greater as many different people from around the world came to the United States and often decided to live in California. California is thought to be a very <a href="/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> state, but there are still a lot of people who are <a href="/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republicans</a> and view <a href="/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> as a hero. Technology is very advanced and many new cultural trends begin there. <a href="/Engineering" title="Engineering">Engineering</a> and <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a> play a big part in the state's life. For over a hundred years, <a href="/Movie" title="Movie">film</a> has been one of the most important businesses in California. By the 1950s, <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a> had also become an important business in California.</p>
