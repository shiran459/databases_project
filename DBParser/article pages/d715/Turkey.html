<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>People have been living in <a href="/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> (the Asian part of Turkey - also called <a href="/Asia_Minor" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>) longer than almost anywhere else in the world, except Africa. </p>
<p>The first major empire in the area was the <a href="/Hittites" title="Hittites">Hittites</a> (from the 18th century to the 13th century BC). The Hittites, who spoke one of the <a href="/Indo-European_languages" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European languages</a>, developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the <a href="/Cimmerians" title="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> in the 7th century BC and the successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia.</p>
<p>From 1950 <a href="/BCE" title="BCE">BCE</a>, <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> and <a href="/Assyrian" title="Assyrian">Assyrians</a> inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BC). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until the Assyrian Empire was conquered by <a href="/Babylonia" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> in the year 612 BC. Then <a href="/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> became home for various kingdoms including the <a href="/Achaemenid_Empire" title="Achaemenid Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, <a href="/Hellenistic_kingdoms" title="Hellenistic kingdoms">Hellenistic kingdoms</a>, <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, <a href="/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> (Eastern Roman Empire), <a href="/Seljuk_Empire" title="Seljuk Empire">Seljuk Empire</a>, and  <a href="/Mongol_Empire" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a>.</p>
<p>During the 14th century, after the fall of the <a href="/Mongol_Empire" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a>, Lord Osman built a new empire named after himself: the <a href="/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the <a href="/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>, (<a href="/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>) in  <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.  The Kingdom was ruled by Muslim law, but other religions had certain <a href="/Minority_rights" title="Minority rights">minority rights</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> the Ottoman Empire was one of the <a href="/Central_Powers" title="Central Powers">Central Powers</a>. During the war, 500,000 <a href="/Armenians" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called <a href="/Armenian_Genocide" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>. Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, but after that <a href="/Ataturk" title="Ataturk">Ataturk</a> led the army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the Greeks.  <a href="/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk" title="Mustafa Kemal Atatürk">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</a> was the first <a href="/President_of_Turkey" title="President of Turkey">President of Turkey</a>.  He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the things he did because they thought they were against <a href="/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example.</p>
<p>For many years <a href="/Kurdish_people" title="Kurdish people">Kurdish</a> <a href="/Guerrilla" title="Guerrilla">guerrillas</a> (usually called the "PKK") led by <a href="/Abdullah_%C3%96calan" title="Abdullah Öcalan">Abdullah Öcalan</a> have been fighting the Turkish government. They said they were fighting so that the <a href="/Kurd" title="Kurd">Kurds</a> in the south east of Turkey could have <a href="/Autonomy" title="Autonomy">autonomy</a> and decide more things for themselves. But the government and most countries in the world call them <a href="/Terrorist" title="Terrorist">terrorists</a>.</p>
<p>On 15 July 2016, a <a href="/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">coup d'état</a> was <a href="/2016_Turkish_coup_d'%C3%A9tat_attempt" title="2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt">attempted</a>.</p>

About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are <a href="/Ethnic" title="Ethnic">ethnic</a> <a href="/Turkish_people" title="Turkish people">Turks</a>. About 15% are ethnic <a href="/Kurd" title="Kurd">Kurds</a>.

<p>The vast majority of Turks are <a href="/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>. The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe. </p>
<p>Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as <a href="/Mant%C4%B1" title="Mantı">mantı</a> (Turkish <a href="/Ravioli" title="Ravioli">ravioli</a>), <a href="/D%C3%B6ner" title="Döner">döner</a>, <a href="/Kebab" title="Kebab">kebabs</a>, Turkish delight, baklava, börek, köfte, and other foods.</p>
<p>Much of the population in Turkey is made up of <a href="/Teenager" title="Teenager">teenagers</a> and young adults. </p>
<p>According to a study, Anatolia is <a href="/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetically</a> more closely related to the <a href="/Balkans" title="Balkans">Balkan</a> populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of <a href="/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from <a href="/Central_Asia" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The population is mainly from the <a href="/Greeks" title="Greeks">Greeks</a>, <a href="/Armenians" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> and <a href="/Kurds" title="Kurds">Kurds</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="European_Union">European Union</span></h2>
<p>Turkey is trying to join the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union (EU)</a>. The EU says that before Turkey can join, it must start trading with the <a href="/Republic_of_Cyprus" title="Republic of Cyprus">Republic of Cyprus</a> and improve <a href="/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
<p>Turkey is in the <a href="/OECD" title="OECD">OECD</a> and the <a href="/G-20" title="G-20">G-20</a> and is one of the 20 largest economies.  The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for their summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey.</p>
<p>Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut Özal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property.  Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit.</p>
<p>Turkey mostly buys and sells with the <a href="/EU" title="EU">EU</a>, the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey. </p>
<p>Turkey's <a href="/Export" title="Export">exports</a> in 2010 were worth 117 billion <a href="/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">United States dollars</a>. </p>
<p>Turkey has no <a href="/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> or <a href="/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Northern Turkish Cyprus.</p>
