<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Medieval_Hungary.2C_896-1526">Medieval Hungary, 896-1526</span></h3>


<p>The Magyars established Hungary in 896, after they had arrived there from their previous, Eastern European territories. Prince Árpád was their leader at the time; he also established the first royal house of the country, the Árpád-house. In <a href="/1000" title="1000">1000</a>, after the first king, <a href="/Saint_Stephen" title="Saint Stephen">Saint Stephen</a> had been crowned, the country became a Kingdom. </p>
<p>In <a href="/1241" title="1241">1241</a>, the <a href="/Tatars" title="Tatars">Tatars</a> (Mongols) invaded the country, causing many deaths and damages. In <a href="/1301" title="1301">1301</a>, the Árpád-house died out. Later on, kings from various houses were ruling over Hungary. The greatest of them is Matthias Corvinus, famous for protecting the country against the <a href="/Ottoman" title="Ottoman">Ottoman</a> aggression. However, some decades after he had died (<a href="/1490" title="1490">1490</a>), the Ottomans defeated the country in the Battle of Mohács (<a href="/1526" title="1526">1526</a>). The Kingdom was cut up to three parts: the western and northern areas remained Hungary, the southern region fell under Ottoman rule, and the eastern parts became semi-independent as the Principality of <a href="/Transylvania" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Between_1526-1867">Between 1526-1867</span></h3>
<p>The Kingdom of Hungary became a <a href="/Habsburg" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> dependency, because an agreement made in <a href="/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> in <a href="/1515" title="1515">1515</a> said that the Habsburg family would take over the territory of the Jagellion family in <a href="/Bohemia" title="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> and Hungary if the line of kings should die out. In <a href="/1686" title="1686">1686</a>, the Ottomans were forced to leave, and the country was reunified. Many nationalities were living in the country at this time. Along with Hungarians, there were also the ancestors of modern <a href="/Slovaks" title="Slovaks">Slovaks</a>, <a href="/Serbs" title="Serbs">Serbs</a>, and <a href="/Romanians" title="Romanians">Romanians</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/1703" title="1703">1703</a>, Francis II Rákóczi, a Hungarian nobleman organized a revolution against the Habsburgs, as Hungarians were not satisfied with them. However, his revolution failed in <a href="/1711" title="1711">1711</a>, and he had to go to <a href="/Exile" title="Exile">exile</a>. The next most important event is the "Hungarian Revolution of 1848", when the inhabitants of the country mutinied again. Fighting ended in <a href="/1849" title="1849">1849</a>, with Habsburg success. The leaders of the revolution were executed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Austria-Hungary.2C_1867-1918">Austria-Hungary, 1867-1918</span></h3>
<p>The country tried to find the way towards consolidation: in <a href="/1867" title="1867">1867</a>, the two most important Habsburg territory, Austria and Hungary signed a treaty, and they established the <a href="/Austria-Hungary" title="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> Monarchy. The new situation was feasible for both sides: the agreement brought massive economic growth.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Between_the_World_Wars.2C_1918-1946">Between the World Wars, 1918-1946</span></h3>

<p>In 1918 after the defeat in <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the Kingdom was abolished, and a republic was established, as people had enough of war. This republic was short-lived, and soon the Communists seized power (<a href="/1919" title="1919">1919</a>).  Their rule was irresponsible and many people, including the peasants and the <a href="/Intelligentsia" title="Intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>, were tortured. The communists had to abandon the country as <a href="/Romania" title="Romania">Romanian</a> troops invaded.  </p>
<p>In late 1919, the Hungarian forces, led by Admiral Miklós Horthy, finally occupied the capital, <a href="/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>.  In response to the communist terror, they launched the "White Terror", in which they persecuted the communists and their supporters. The kingdom was re-established but there was no king. Horthy was elected as the <a href="/Regent" title="Regent">regent</a> of the country, as the assembly decided not to recall the Habsburgs.</p>
<p>Hungary lost the war. According to the <a href="/Treaty_of_Trianon" title="Treaty of Trianon">Treaty of Trianon</a> (<a href="/1920" title="1920">1920</a>), Hungary lost two thirds of its territory. On the majority of these territories, non-Hungarians were the majority; however, many Hungarians also found themselves outside their country, in the nation state of <a href="/Romanians" title="Romanians">Romanians</a> or <a href="/Slovaks" title="Slovaks">Slovaks</a>. Thus, the main political goal of the governments under Horthy was to revise this treaty, and at least, to <a href="/Irredentism" title="Irredentism">regain</a> the Hungarian-inhabited lands.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Communist_Hungary.2C_1946-1989">Communist Hungary, 1946-1989</span></h3>
<p>After the fall of <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, Soviet troops occupied all of the country. So Hungary gradually became a communist satellite state of the Soviet Union. After 1948, Communist leader <a href="/M%C3%A1ty%C3%A1s_R%C3%A1kosi" title="Mátyás Rákosi">Mátyás Rákosi</a> established Stalinist rule in the country. He forced collectivization and <a href="/Planned_economy" title="Planned economy">planned economy</a>. This led to the <a href="/1956_Hungarian_Revolution" title="1956 Hungarian Revolution">1956 Hungarian Revolution</a>. Hungary withdrew from the <a href="/Warsaw_Pact" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>.  But the Soviets sent in over 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Nearly a quarter of a million people left the country during the brief time that the borders were open in 1956. <a href="/J%C3%A1nos_K%C3%A1d%C3%A1r" title="János Kádár">János Kádár</a> became leader of the communist party. In 1991 Soviet military presence in Hungary ended and the transition to a market economy began.</p>
