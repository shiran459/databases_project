<b>General semantics</b> is a <a href="/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning. It was created by <a href="/Alfred_Korzybski" title="Alfred Korzybski">Alfred Korzybski</a> during the <a href="/1920s" title="1920s">1920s</a> and early <a href="/1930s" title="1930s">1930s</a>. </p>
<p>The goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something, either <a href="/Mind" title="Mind">mentally</a> or in <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a>, that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified. How people understand <a href="/Reality" title="Reality">reality</a> is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality. General semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen, heard, felt, or believed.</p>
