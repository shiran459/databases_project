<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The development of farming gave rise to the <a href="/Neolithic_Revolution" title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> whereby people gave up <a href="/Nomad" title="Nomad">nomadic</a> <a href="/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a> and became <a href="/Settler" title="Settler">settlers</a> in what became <a href="/Cities" title="Cities">cities</a>.</p>
<p>Agriculture and <a href="/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> probably started in the <a href="/Fertile_Crescent" title="Fertile Crescent">Fertile Crescent</a> (the <a href="/Nile" title="Nile">Nile</a> Valley, The <a href="/Levant" title="Levant">Levant</a> and <a href="/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of <a href="/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="/Jordan" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>, and <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">Wheat</a> and <a href="/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a> are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than <a href="/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> can feed on the same amount of land.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kinds_of_farming">Kinds of farming</span></h2>
<p>Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like <a href="/Flower" title="Flower">flowers</a> and <a href="/Nursery" title="Nursery">nursery</a> <a href="/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>, manure or dung, <a href="/Animal_hides" title="Animal hides">animal hides</a> (skins or furs), <a href="/Leather" title="Leather">leather</a>, animals, fungi, <a href="/Fiber" title="Fiber">fibers</a> (<a href="/Cotton" title="Cotton">cotton</a>, <a href="/Wool" title="Wool">wool</a>, <a href="/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>, and <a href="/Flax" title="Flax">flax</a>), <a href="/Biofuel" title="Biofuel">biofuels</a> , and <a href="/Drug" title="Drug">drugs</a> (bio<a href="/Pharmaceuticals" title="Pharmaceuticals">pharmaceuticals</a>, <a href="/Marijuana" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>, <a href="/Opium" title="Opium">opium</a>).</p>
<p>Many people still live by <a href="/Subsistence_agriculture" title="Subsistence agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a>, on a small farm.  They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals.  Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The <a href="/Yield" title="Yield">yield</a> is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less <a href="/Education" title="Education">educated</a>, and they have less <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> to buy equipment. <a href="/Drought" title="Drought">Drought</a> and other problems sometimes cause <a href="/Famine" title="Famine">famines</a>.  Where yields are low, <a href="/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> can provide new land to grow more food.  This provides more <a href="/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a> for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding <a href="/Environment" title="Environment">environment</a> over many years.</p>
<p>In rich countries, farms are often fewer and larger.  During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better <a href="/Variety_(botany)" title="Variety (botany)">varieties</a> of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests.  Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land.  There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. </p>
<p>This kind of <a href="/Intensive_agriculture" title="Intensive agriculture">intensive agriculture</a> comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, <a href="/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a> (chemicals that kill bugs), and <a href="/Herbicide" title="Herbicide">herbicides</a> (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can <a href="/Pollute" title="Pollute">pollute</a> the <a href="/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a> or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by <a href="/Erosion" title="Erosion">erosion</a> (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. <a href="/Irrigation" title="Irrigation">Irrigation</a> (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.</p>

<p>Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and <a href="/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutritional</a> value.  They also choose plants that can survive <a href="/Plant_disease" title="Plant disease">plant disease</a> and drought, and are easier to harvest.  Centuries of <a href="/Artificial_selection" title="Artificial selection">artificial selection</a> and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).</p>
<p>Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.</p>
<p>New plants were created with <a href="/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>. One example of <a href="/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a> is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Food">Food</span></h2>
<p>It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.</li>
<li>Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. </li>
<li>Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. </li>
<li>Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/Agricultural_policy" title="Agricultural policy">Agricultural policy</a> focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:</p>
