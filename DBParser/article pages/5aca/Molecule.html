A <b>molecule</b> is the smallest amount of a <a href="/Chemical_substance" title="Chemical substance">chemical substance</a> that can exist. If a molecule were split into smaller pieces, it would be a different substance.</p>
<p>Molecules are made up of <a href="/Atom" title="Atom">atoms</a> that are stuck together in a particular shape or <a href="/Form" title="Form">form</a>. Not all combinations of atoms are usually possible; atoms like certain shapes, but not others. Also, they like certain arrangements of atoms. For example, <a href="/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> atoms always have two bonds with other atoms, <a href="/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> atoms always have four bonds with other atoms, and <a href="/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a> atoms always have three bonds with other atoms.</p>
<p>In the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases">kinetic theory of gases</a>, the term <i>molecule</i> is often used for any gaseous <a href="/Particle" title="Particle">particle</a> regardless of its composition. According to this definition, <a href="/Noble_gas" title="Noble gas">noble gas</a> atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a> like <a href="/Air" title="Air">air</a>, the molecules are just flying around. In <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a> like <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>, the molecules are stuck together but they can still move. In <a href="/Solid" title="Solid">solids</a> like <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, the molecules can only <a href="/Vibrate" title="Vibrate">vibrate</a>.  In the fourth <a href="/State_of_matter" title="State of matter">state of matter</a> known as <a href="/Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a>, the atoms are <a href="/Ionization" title="Ionization">ionized</a> and cannot form molecules.</p>
<p>With a <a href="/Molecular_formula" title="Molecular formula">molecular formula</a>, you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule. For example, the molecular formula of <a href="/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. That means that one molecule of glucose is made up of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms.</p>

<p>For a molecule to exist, <a href="/Atoms" title="Atoms">atoms</a> have to stick together. This happens when two atoms share <a href="/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a>. Instead of circling just one atom, the electron now circles around two. This is called a <a href="/Covalent_bond" title="Covalent bond">covalent bond</a>.  Sometimes, more than one electron is shared. The more electrons are shared, the stronger the bond gets and the stronger the atoms stick together.</p>
<p>Bonds can also be broken apart. Since most bonds require energy to form, they also give off energy when they are broken. But before most bonds break, the molecule has to be heated. Then the atoms start to move, and when they move too much, the bond breaks. Molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called fuels. For example, a candle will just sit there and nothing happens. But when you use a match to light it, it will burn for a long time. The match brings the energy to break the first bonds, which release enough energy to break the bonds below them, until the candle has burned down.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="/Ionic_bond" title="Ionic bond">ionic bonds</a>.</p>
