<p><b>Advertising</b> is how a <a href="/Company" title="Company">company</a> <a href="/Promotion" title="Promotion">encourages</a> people to buy their <a href="/Product_(business)" title="Product (business)">products</a>, <a href="/Service" title="Service">services</a> or <a href="/Idea" title="Idea">ideas</a>. An advertisement (or "ad" for short) is anything that draws good attention towards these things. It is usually designed by an advertising agency for an identified sponsor, and performed through a variety of <a href="/Media" title="Media">media</a>. Ads appear on <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a>, as well as <a href="/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a>, <a href="/Newspaper" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a>, <a href="/Magazine" title="Magazine">magazines</a> and as <a href="/Billboard" title="Billboard">billboards</a> in <a href="/Street" title="Street">streets</a> and <a href="/Cities" title="Cities">cities</a>. They try to get people to buy their products, by showing them the good rather than bad of their products.</p>
<p>Advertisers influence our <a href="/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotions</a> by techniques that include stereotyping and targeting the <a href="/Audience" title="Audience">audience</a> according to who we are.  Emotions are influenced by things such as this our occupation, beliefs, <a href="/Personality" title="Personality">personality</a>, <a href="/Self_esteem" title="Self esteem">self esteem</a>, <a href="/Lifestyle" title="Lifestyle">lifestyle</a>, relationships, <a href="/Friend" title="Friend">friends</a>, how we look and what we wear.

<p>Commercial messages and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of <a href="/Pompeii" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> and ancient <a href="/Arabian_Peninsula" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabia</a>. <a href="/Lost_and_found" title="Lost and found">Lost and found</a> advertising on <a href="/Papyrus" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a> was common in <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> and <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a>. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is  present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian <a href="/Rock_art" title="Rock art">rock art</a> paintings that date back to 4000 BC.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Bhatia"><a href="#_note-Bhatia" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Londoner <a href="/Thomas_J._Barratt" title="Thomas J. Barratt">Thomas J. Barratt</a>  (1841–1914) has been called "the father of modern advertising".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-mat"><a href="#_note-mat" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-nick"><a href="#_note-nick" title="">[4]</a></sup> He worked for the <a href="/Pears_Soap" title="Pears Soap">Pears Soap</a> company, eventually becoming its Chairman. Barratt created an advertising campaign for the company products. It used targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-obit"><a href="#_note-obit" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-part"><a href="#_note-part" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mat_b"><a href="#_note-mat" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.
Very important was the growth of <a href="/Mass_media" title="Mass media">mass media</a>, with mass circulation illustrated newspapers in the later 19th century followed by <a href="/Film" title="Film">film</a>, <a href="/Radio" title="Radio">radio</a> and <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_advertising">Types of advertising</span></h2>
<p>Advertising happens in many different ways.  Many products are advertised on <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a>, although not all channels permit advertising. The advertisements usually appear during breaks between a <a href="/Television_show" title="Television show">television show</a>. They are usually for products, other television shows or movies and are not normally much longer than 30 seconds. Some <a href="/Radio_station" title="Radio station">radio stations</a> have <a href="/Audio" title="Audio">audio</a> advertisements that play between programmes.</p>
<p>An advertisement for a <a href="/Movie" title="Movie">movie</a> is called a <a href="/Trailer_(movie)" title="Trailer (movie)">trailer</a>. It shows a short collection of clips from the movie, and shows the date it will be released in <a href="/Cinema" title="Cinema">cinemas</a>.</p>
<p>Advertising also takes place on <a href="/Website" title="Website">websites</a>. These may appear as "banner ads" or "<a href="/Popup" title="Popup">popups</a>". They are often still <a href="/Image" title="Image">images</a> or <a href="/Macromedia_Flash" title="Macromedia Flash">flash</a> <a href="/Animation" title="Animation">animations</a>. The owner of the website will get <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> when a user clicks on the advertisement. Sometimes they will get a <a href="/Percent" title="Percent">percentage</a> of the money if they buy a <a href="/Product_(consumer_goods)" title="Product (consumer goods)">product</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/Billboard" title="Billboard">Billboards</a> advertise products on highways and city streets. These may simply be freestanding billboards or may be part of street furniture such as a bus shelter.  Buses and taxis are often covered in adverts, while budget airlines sometimes allow advertising inside their planes. Adverts also appear in newspapers, magazines and sports programmes.  Many <a href="/Stadium" title="Stadium">stadiums</a> have adverts set around them.  Sports teams, tournaments, television programmes and public events may have a <a href="/Sponsor" title="Sponsor">sponsor</a> who is the main or sometimes only advertiser.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Techniques">Techniques</span></h2>
<p>Advertisers use many different techniques to get people to notice their adverts, often using deliberately shocking or provocative images.Once they have managed to make people notice their advert, they need to 'sell' the product or brand. They may try to make the product look appealing, however often advertisers use humor in such a way that get people to remember the brand without actually promoting the product.  Poor adverts can damage sales or spoil a brand's identity.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Regulations">Regulations</span></h2>
<p>Advertising is often strictly regulated, for instance in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> it is illegal to advertise tobacco, except in the shop where it is sold and this is also restricted.  In <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> it is illegal to advertise alcohol, meaning that when many European football teams play in France, they cannot play in their usual shirts as breweries often advertise on sports shirts.  It is also illegal to advertise on some television channels, the <a href="/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="/RTE" title="RTE">RTE</a> in the <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> are not allowed to permit advertising and instead make their revenue from selling a compulsory <a href="/Television_licence" title="Television licence">television licence</a>.</p>
