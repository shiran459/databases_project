<p><b>Like</b> can mean some different things: </p>
<p>1. We can use <b>to like</b> to say that we find a thing is good: 
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>I like my house.</i> = I think my house is good.</dd>
<dd><i>I like Jenny</i> = I think Jenny is an OK person.</dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>2. We can use <b>like</b> for "the same as" or "nearly the same as":
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>This <a href="/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheese</a> <a href="/Sandwich" title="Sandwich">sandwich</a> feels like <a href="/Rubber" title="Rubber">rubber</a></i> = the sandwich is difficult to eat, nearly the same as rubber.</dd>
<dd><i>Jenny is like her mother</i> = Jenny has brown hair, and her mother also has brown hair (for example). </dd>
<dd><i>Your pen is like my pen</i> = Your pen and my pen are the same <a href="/Sort" title="Sort">sort</a>.</dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>3. We can also use <b>like</b> for "the same way as":
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>She runs like the wind</i> - she and the wind are both fast.</dd>
<dd><i>She talks like a child</i> - she and children speak slowly or with a high voice.</dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>4. In a question, we can use <b>like</b> to ask people to talk about a thing, or to say if they find it good or not:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>What's your house like?</i> (Answer: "It has two bedrooms and a big kitchen...")</dd>
<dd><i>What was the film like?</i> (Answer: "It was very good!")</dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>5. We can also use <b>like</b> as "for example":
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>I often go to other countries, like France or Germany</i> = I go to other countries, for example France and Germany.</dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>6. In British and American English young people, when talking, have recently started using <b>like</b> as an extra word in the middle of sentences. Sometimes they use it to report what someone said, especially when mimicking the way they said it. This should never be used in writing:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The teacher was <b>like</b>: "Don't do that!"</i></dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>


<p><a href="/As" title="As">As</a> works in the same way as example 2 - comparing two things using either the word "like" or the word "as" is called making a <b>simile</b> (<i>As big as an elephant</i>). It may be better to use the word "as" for this to stop confusion with example 1.</p>
