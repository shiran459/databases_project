<p>
A <b>tributary</b> of a <a href="/River" title="River">river</a> is another river that <a href="/Flux" title="Flux">flows</a> into it. If one river flows into a second river, then the first river is a <b>tributary</b> of the second river. A tributary is a body of water that flows into another body of water.</p>
<p>The opposite of a tributary is a distributary, a river that branches off from the main flow of water. A tributary is very important for a village to submerge</p>
