<dd><i>Note: this is not a complete summary</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The side which scores the most goals wins. If scores are equal, the result is a draw.</li>
<li>The officials in a football game are a <a href="/Referee" title="Referee">referee</a> and two linesmen. </li>
<li>Goals are scored by getting the ball into the  opponents' goal, more than halfway across the line.
<ul>
<li>Referees have access to goal-line cameras to decide close cases.</li>
<li>The <i><a href="/Offside_rule" title="Offside rule">offside rule</a></i> means that there have to be at least two defenders between the attacker and the defenders' goal when the attacker's teammate passes the ball to him/her. (This is not a complete summary: the rule is complex). Usually, one of the two defenders is the goalkeeper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Players may not use their hands or arms (handball), except the goalkeeper, who may use them within his own <i>penalty area</i> (<i>penalty areas</i> are in front of both goals).</li>
<li>The ball is out of play if it crosses the field boundaries.
<ul>
<li>If a player kicks the ball out of play at the side of the field, the other team gets to throw the ball back into play (a <i>throw in</i>).</li>
<li>If a player kicks the ball out of play at their end of the field, the other team kicks the ball back into play from the corner (a <i>corner kick</i>);</li>
<li>If a player kicks the ball out of play at the other end of the field, the other team kicks the ball back into play from directly in front of the goal (a <i>goal kick</i>).</li>
</ul></li>
