<p><b>Writing</b> is the act of <a href="/Recording" title="Recording">recording</a> <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a> on a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/visual">visual</a> <a href="/Media" title="Media">medium</a> using a set of <a href="/Symbol" title="Symbol">symbols</a>. The symbols must be known to others, so that the <a href="/Text" title="Text">text</a> may be <a href="/Read" title="Read">read</a>.</p>
<p>A text may also use other visual systems, such as <a href="/Illustration" title="Illustration">illustrations</a> and decorations. These are not called writing, but may help the message work. Usually, all educated people in a country use the same <a href="/Writing_system" title="Writing system">writing system</a> to record the same language. To be able to read and write is to be <a href="/Literacy" title="Literacy">literate</a>.</p>
<p>Writing differs from <a href="/Speech" title="Speech">speech</a> because <i>the readers need not be present at the time</i>.  We can read writing from long ago, and from different parts of the world.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ong"><a href="#_note-Ong" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Text stores and communicates <a href="/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a>. Writing is one of the greatest <a href="/Invention" title="Invention">inventions</a> of the human species. It was invented after people settled in <a href="/Town" title="Town">towns</a>, and after <a href="/Neolithic_revolution" title="Neolithic revolution">agriculture started</a>. Writing dates from about 3,300<small>BC</small>, which is over 5000 years ago, in the <a href="/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>.</p>
<p>Writing today is usually on <a href="/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>, though there are ways to print on almost any surface.   <a href="/Television" title="Television">Television</a> and <a href="/Movie" title="Movie">movie</a> <a href="/Screen" title="Screen">screens</a> can also display writing, and so can computer screens.  Many writing materials were invented, long before <a href="/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>. <a href="/Clay" title="Clay">Clay</a>, <a href="/Papyrus" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a>, <a href="/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a>, <a href="/Slate" title="Slate">slate</a> and <a href="/Parchment" title="Parchment">parchment</a> (prepared animal skins) have all been used. The <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> wrote on <a href="/Wax_tablet" title="Wax tablet">waxed tablets</a> with a pointed <a href="/Stylus" title="Stylus">stylus</a>; this was popular for temporary notes and messages.  The later invention of paper by the <a href="/China" title="China">Chinese</a> was a big step forward.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Robo"><a href="#_note-Robo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Diri"><a href="#_note-Diri" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Writing is traditionally done using a <a href="/Hand" title="Hand">hand</a> <a href="/Tool" title="Tool">tool</a> such as a <a href="/Pencil" title="Pencil">pencil</a>, a <a href="/Pen" title="Pen">pen</a>, or a <a href="/Brush" title="Brush">brush</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition_of_writing">Definition of writing</span></h2>
<p>There are two schools of thought:<sup class="reference" id="_ref-DeF"><a href="#_note-DeF" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Partial writing</i>: Writing is any system of graphic symbols which conveys <i>some</i> thought. </li>
<li><i>Full writing</i>: Writing is any graphic system which can convey <i>any and all</i> thought.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-DeF_b"><a href="#_note-DeF" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup>p5</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, depending on an author's definition of writing, the term may be used in different ways. With many early systems we do not know what they do convey. The central idea is that <i>a full writing system must be able to represent anything that might be said in spoken language</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-DeF_c"><a href="#_note-DeF" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup>p7, 217</sup> From this point of view the invention of the <a href="/Rebus" title="Rebus">rebus</a> is an essential step.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>We can only be sure a sign system is full writing if we can translate the symbols into a modern language. In the case of some ancient scripts we cannot do this.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_writing">History of writing</span></h2>
<p>Writing was invented independently a number of times. The <a href="/Sumer" title="Sumer">Sumerian</a>, the <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptian</a>, the <a href="/China" title="China">Chinese</a> and the <a href="/Maya_civilization" title="Maya civilization">Mayan</a> writings are separate in their invention.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ong_b"><a href="#_note-Ong" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup>p85</sup> All these writing systems started with <i>pictographs</i>, symbols that stood for things. Then they developed a mixture of methods. Our own <a href="/Alphabet" title="Alphabet">alphabetic</a> system  is different. It is based on the sounds of <a href="/Speech" title="Speech">spoken</a> language. All alphabets are modified versions of the first one, which originated with the <a href="/Phoenicians" title="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a> and the <a href="/Ancient_Greeks" title="Ancient Greeks">Ancient Greeks</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sumer">Sumer</span></h3>


<p>The <a href="/Sumer" title="Sumer">Sumerians</a> lived in <a href="/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> between the <a href="/Tigris" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="/Euphrates" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> rivers. 5000 years ago this was a fertile region and is now mostly in <a href="/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. The Sumerians developed a form of writing called <a href="/Cuneiform" title="Cuneiform">cuneiform</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> <a href="/Triangle" title="Triangle">Triangular</a> marks were pressed into soft clay tablets. After the clay had dried in the sun the tablets were <a href="/Bake" title="Bake">baked</a>. Then they were carried somewhere else for others to read. We know that its first uses were for <a href="/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a>, <a href="/Accounting" title="Accounting">accounting</a> and <a href="/Administration" title="Administration">administration</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest signs were mostly <a href="/Picture" title="Picture">pictorial</a>, but soon they stood as symbols for objects, ideas and sounds. This writing system was extremely successful, and outlasted the Sumerian empire. It was then used by other civilisations in the Middle East, such as the Old 
<a href="/Akkad" title="Akkad">Akkadian</a>, <a href="/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylonian</a>, <a href="/Assyria" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a>, <a href="/Elamite" title="Elamite">Elamite</a>, <a href="/Hittites" title="Hittites">Hittite</a>, <a href="/Persian_Empire" title="Persian Empire">Old Persian</a> and <a href="/Ugar" title="Ugar">Ugaritic</a> <a href="/Empire" title="Empire">empires</a>. The last cuneiform inscription was dated as <small>AD</small>75. Thus the system had lasted for more than 3000 years.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Robo_b"><a href="#_note-Robo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup>p71</sup> Each version of cuneiform had to be deciphered separately, because all the languages were different. Documents (including stone objects) written in more than one language provided the clues.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_Egypt">Ancient Egypt</span></h3>


<p>
This is the most famous of the old forms of writing, or <i>scripts</i>. It was invented at roughly the same time as cuneiform, yet was quite different in style, and used different materials. <a href="/Ancient_Egypt#Writing" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptians</a> ended up with three writing systems for the same language. They were:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. <a href="/Hieroglyph" title="Hieroglyph">Hieroglyphic</a>: the famous pictorial language on stone monuments.</dd>
<dd>2. Hieratic: a cursive  ('running') script used by the priests.</dd>
<dd>3. Demotic: a cursive script used by the people.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <a href="/Writing_tool" title="Writing tool">writing tools</a> used varied according to the material which was written on. The two cursive scripts were written with <a href="/Reed_(plant)" title="Reed (plant)">reed</a> <a href="/Pen" title="Pen">pens</a> and <a href="/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a> <a href="/Ink" title="Ink">inks</a> onto <a href="/Papyrus" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a>. If the material was <a href="/Cloth" title="Cloth">cloth</a>, then the writing was done by a brush. Many examples survive. The hieroglyphs were inscribed (carved) into stone (<a href="/Hammer" title="Hammer">hammer</a> &amp; <a href="/Chisel" title="Chisel">chisel</a>) or <a href="/Paint" title="Paint">painted</a> onto stone surfaces. Many survive, some with the original colours intact. The key event in the decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was the discovery of the <a href="/Rosetta_Stone" title="Rosetta Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>. This is a <a href="/Granite" title="Granite">granite</a> slab with the same message written in hieroglyphic, demotic and in Greek. Ancient Greek is well understood, and made possible the interpretation of the other two scripts.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chinese">Chinese</span></h3>
<p>Chinese is the language with the largest number of native speakers. Its history dates back to about 1400<small>BC</small>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Robo_c"><a href="#_note-Robo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup>p183</sup> The Chinese writing system is idio-syllabic, a mixed method using characters which may have one or more of these elements:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Pictographic: representing objects.</dd>
<dd>2. Visual logic: the number '3' is three horizontal strokes.</dd>
<dd>3. Complex logic: the sun is a box with a horizontal mid-stroke.</dd>
<dd>4. Rebus: "sounds like..." the character for <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> is also used for 'come' because the words are <i>homophonous</i> (sound alike).</dd>
<dd>5. Semantic-phonetic: combination of a character for meaning with another for sound (pronunciation).</dd>
</dl>


<p>Chinese has a huge number of characters: in the region of 50,000.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Robo_d"><a href="#_note-Robo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup>p186</sup> Because of this, <a href="/Printing" title="Printing">printing</a> methods were never really successful in China, despite their early invention. In the 14th century, Wang Tzhen, had sixty thousand wood block characters cut, a huge investment in time and money. He printed 100 copies of a local gazette, and was author of a treatise on agriculture and other technical works. Even with printing machines from Europe in the 19th century, the process was hampered by the huge number of characters, which slowed the <i>composition</i> to a snail's pace.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>China has eight regional languages that are mutually unintelligible, and many true dialects. The system appears to work mainly because as many as 70% speak <a href="/Mandarin_language" title="Mandarin language">Mandarin</a>. Fluency in Chinese reading and writing is undoubtedly difficult to achieve, and this must act as a brake on the drive for <a href="/Literacy" title="Literacy">literacy</a>. There have been a number of attempts to reform or simplify the system. The most radical in <a href="/Pinyin" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a>, which is a program to replace Chinese characters with an alphabetic system. This was supported by <a href="/Mao" title="Mao">Mao</a>, but faltered after his death.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alphabets">Alphabets</span></h2>


<p>It seems that the idea of an alphabet‚Äìa script based entirely upon sound‚Äìarose only once, and has been copied and adapted to suit many different languages. Although no alphabet fits its language perfectly, it is flexible enough to fit any language approximately. It was a unique invention.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup>p12</sup></p> 
<p>Our alphabet is called the <a href="/Roman_alphabet" title="Roman alphabet">Roman alphabet</a>, as compared with the <a href="/Cyrillic_alphabet" title="Cyrillic alphabet">Cyrillic</a> and other alphabets. All of these come from the ancient <a href="/Greek_alphabet" title="Greek alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>, which dates back to about 1100 to 800<small>BC</small>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Robo_e"><a href="#_note-Robo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup>p167</sup> The Greek alphabet was probably developed from the Phoenician script, which appeared somewhat earlier, and had some similar letter-shapes.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Phoenician_language" title="Phoenician language">Phoenician language</a> was a <a href="/Semitic_languages" title="Semitic languages">Semitic language</a>, often called Canaanite. The Semitic group of languages includes <a href="/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>, Maltese, <a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> and also <a href="/Aramaic" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, the language spoken by <a href="/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. We do not know much about how the alphabetic idea arose, but the Phoenicians, a trading people, came up with letters which were adapted by the early Greeks to produce their alphabet. The one big difference is that the Phoenician script had no pure <a href="/Vowels" title="Vowels">vowels</a>. Arabic script has vowels which may be shown by <a href="/Diacritic" title="Diacritic">diacritics</a> (small marks above or below the line).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-14"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The oldest Qu'ran manuscripts had no diacritics.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-15"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> <a href="/Israeli" title="Israeli">Israeli</a> children today use texts with vowel 'dots' added, to about the third grade.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ong_c"><a href="#_note-Ong" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup>p89</sup></p>
<p>No ancient script, alphabetic or not, had pure vowels before the Greeks. The Greek alphabet even has two vowels for 'e' and two for 'o', to distinguish between the long and short sounds.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-16"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> It is fairly clear from this that careful thought went into both the Phoenician invention and the Greek adaptation. However, no details survive of either process.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Diri_b"><a href="#_note-Diri" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Semitic scripts apparently derive from <i>Proto-Sinaitic</i>, a script of which only 31 inscriptions (plus 17 doubtful) are known. It is thought by some researchers that the original source of this script was the Egyptian hieratic script. By the late Middle Kingdom (about 1900<small>BC</small>) hieratic had added some alphabetic signs for representing the <a href="/Consonant" title="Consonant">consonants</a> of foreign names. Egyptian activity in Sinai was at its height at that time.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-17"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> A similar idea had been suggested many years before.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-18"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Undeciphered_scripts">Undeciphered scripts</span></h2>
<p>There are a number of scripts which have never been deciphered,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-19"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> despite much effort.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Robo_f"><a href="#_note-Robo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup>p145</sup> Perhaps the most famous are the script of the <a href="/Indus_Valley_civilization" title="Indus Valley civilization">Indus Valley civilization</a>, and <a href="/Etruscan_language" title="Etruscan language">Etruscan</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-20"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The <a href="/Indus_River" title="Indus River">Indus River</a> civilisation predates other literate civilisations on the Indian subcontinent, going back to about 2500<small>BC</small>. Their cities of Mohenjo-Daru and <a href="/Harappa" title="Harappa">Harappa</a> were well-planned, with good drainage. The script is found on seal stones,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-21"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> <a href="/Terracotta" title="Terracotta">terracotta</a>,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-22"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> <a href="/Bronze" title="Bronze">bronze</a>, <a href="/Bone" title="Bone">bone</a> and <a href="/Ivory" title="Ivory">ivory</a>. All are brief, and the language is unknown.</p>
<p>The Etruscan language used Greek letter-forms, and is found mainly on Etruscan <a href="/Tomb" title="Tomb">tombs</a>, from <a href="/Tuscany" title="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> through to <a href="/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>. They were an empire before the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>, who defeated them, and absorbed their ideas.

<p>The <b>TƒÉrtƒÉria tablets</b> are three <a href="/Clay_tablet" title="Clay tablet">tablets</a> discovered in 1961 in the village of <a href="/T%C4%83rt%C4%83ria" title="TƒÉrtƒÉria">TƒÉrtƒÉria</a> (<a href="/Hungarian_language" title="Hungarian language">Hungarian</a>: Als√≥tat√°rlaka).

Some claim they are a yet undeciphered language. If this is so, they would be the earliest known form of writing. In 1908 similar symbols were found during excavations, by Miloje Vasiƒá (1869‚Äì1956) in Vinƒça. This is a suburb of <a href="/Belgrade" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> (<a href="/Serbia" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>), some 300¬†km from Turda»ô. Later, more were found in another part of Belgrade. Since 1875 over one hundred and fifty Vinƒça sites have been found in Serbia alone. Many, including Vinƒça itself, have not been fully excavated. The culture of the whole area is called the Vinƒça culture. Although some of these symbols look exactly the same as some letters in Etruscan, Greek, and Aramaic,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-25"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> they are generally regarded as an original, independent development.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-26"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

In many other parts of the world this did not happen until the 20th century. Until then, <a href="/Literacy" title="Literacy">literacy</a> was mainly for <a href="/Clergy" title="Clergy">clerics</a>, that is, people who had training as <a href="/Priest" title="Priest">priests</a>. Even wealthy people were often illiterate, and used <a href="/Scribe" title="Scribe">scribes</a> to write for them. The invention of <a href="/Printing" title="Printing">printing</a> came before mass literacy. Before 1500, each <a href="/Book" title="Book">book</a> had to be created by hand, so there were few books available compared to the billions in the world today.
