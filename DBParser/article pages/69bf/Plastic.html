A <b>plastic</b> is a <a href="/Material" title="Material">material</a> that can change its shape. Many things are made of plastics, usually because making them the right shape is easy. There are many types of plastic. Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made; then they become hard. Others can be changed by heating them or even by <a href="/Melting" title="Melting">melting</a> them. </p>
<p>Most plastics are man-made; they do not occur in nature.  Most are made from <a href="/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> or <a href="/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>.  The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated. Most of the materials that are called <i>plastic</i> are <a href="/Polymer" title="Polymer">polymers</a>. Polymers are long chains of <a href="/Atoms" title="Atoms">atoms</a> bonded to each other.</p>
<p>People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time. <a href="/Alexander_Parkes" title="Alexander Parkes">Alexander Parkes</a>, an English inventor (1813-1890), created the earliest form of plastic in 1855. It was hard but flexible and transparent, and he called it "Parkesine."</p>
<p>Old plastics are usually thrown away and put in <a href="/Landfill" title="Landfill">landfills</a>. Some plastics release toxic fumes when burned. Plastics are often recycled so they won't become waste.</p>
<p>Plastics are mostly <a href="/Petrochemical" title="Petrochemical">petrochemicals</a>, made from <a href="/Natural_gas" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> or from <a href="/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>, a type of <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>. <a href="/Chemical_engineer" title="Chemical engineer">Chemical engineers</a> refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops <a href="/Ethylene" title="Ethylene">ethylene</a> and <a href="/Propylene" title="Propylene">propylene</a>, which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics. These chemicals are then combined with other chemicals to produce a <a href="/Polymer" title="Polymer">polymer</a>.</p>
