<p>A <a href="/Screenwriter" title="Screenwriter">screenwriter</a> writes a <a href="/Screenplay" title="Screenplay">script</a>, which is the story of the movie with words and things that the actors will say and do. Then a <a href="/Producer" title="Producer">producer</a> hires people to work on the movie and gets all of the money that will be needed to pay for the actors and the equipment. Producers usually get the money by borrowing it from a bank or by getting investors to lend money to the movie production. Some producers work for a movie <a href="/Studio" title="Studio">studio</a>; other producers are independent (they do not work for a movie studio).</p>
<p><a href="/Actor" title="Actor">Actors</a> and <a href="/Movie_director" title="Movie director">directors</a> read scripts to find out what to say and what to do. The actors memorize the words from the script that they will say in the movie, and learn the actions that the script tells them to do. Then the director tells the actors what to do and a <a href="/Cameraman" title="Cameraman">cameraman</a> takes motion pictures of them with a motion picture camera.</p>
<p>When filming has finished, an <a href="/Film_editing" title="Film editing">editor</a> puts the moving pictures together in a way that tells the whole story within a set amount of time. <a href="/Audio_engineer" title="Audio engineer">Audio engineers</a> and sound engineers record music and singing and join it with the moving pictures. When the movie is done, many copies of the movie are made by movie labs and put onto movie reels. Then the movie reels are sent to cinemas. The movie is projected with a <a href="/Movie_projector" title="Movie projector">movie projector</a> onto a large <a href="/Movie_screen" title="Movie screen">projection screen</a> at the front of the auditorium (the room where the audience watches the movie) while the dialogue, sounds and music are played through a number of <a href="/Loudspeaker" title="Loudspeaker">loudspeakers</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Genres">Genres</span></h2>
<p>A <a href="/Genre" title="Genre">genre</a> is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie. Movies can be <a href="/Fiction" title="Fiction">fictional</a> (made up), or true, or a mix of the two. Although hundreds of movies are made every year, there are very few that do not follow a small number of set <a href="/Plot" title="Plot">plots</a>, or stories. Some movies mix together two or more genres.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/Action_movie" title="Action movie">Action movies</a></b> have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights, involving <a href="/Stuntman" title="Stuntman">stuntmen</a>. They usually involve 'goodies' and 'baddies', so war and crime are common subjects. Action movies usually need very little effort to watch, since the plot is normally simple. For example, in <a href="/Die_Hard" title="Die Hard">Die Hard</a>, <a href="/Terrorist" title="Terrorist">terrorists</a> take control of a <a href="/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscraper</a> and ask for a big <a href="/Ransom" title="Ransom">ransom</a> in exchange for not killing the <a href="/Hostage" title="Hostage">hostage</a> workers. One <a href="/Hero" title="Hero">hero</a> somehow manages to save everyone. Action movies do not usually make people cry, but if the action movie is also a drama, emotion will be involved.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Adventure" title="Adventure">Adventure</a></b> Movies usually involve a hero who sets out on a quest to save the world or loved ones.</li>
<li><a href="/Animation" title="Animation"><b>Animated</b></a> movies use artificial images like talking pigs to tell a story. These movies used to be drawn by hand, one <a href="/Frame" title="Frame">frame</a> at a time, but are now made on <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>.</li>
<li><b>Buddy</b> movies involve 2 heroes, one must save the other, both must overcome obstacles. Buddy movies often involve comedy, but there is also some emotion, because of the close friendship between the 'buddies'.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Comedy" title="Comedy">Comedies</a></b> are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things or being in silly or unusual situations that make the audience laugh.</li>
<li><b>Documentaries</b> are movies that are (or claim to be) about real people and real events. They are nearly always serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects, for example cruelty.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Drama" title="Drama">Dramas</a></b> are serious, and often about people falling in love or needing to make a big decision in their life. They tell stories about <a href="/Relationship" title="Relationship">relationships</a> between people. They usually follow a basic <a href="/Plot" title="Plot">plot</a> where one or two main <a href="/Fictional_character" title="Fictional character">characters</a> (each actor plays a character) have to 'overcome' (get past) an <a href="/Obstacle" title="Obstacle">obstacle</a> (the thing stopping them) to get what they want.
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/Tragedy" title="Tragedy">Tragedies</a></b> are always dramas, and are about people in trouble. For example, a husband and wife who are <a href="/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorcing</a> must each try to prove to a <a href="/Court" title="Court">court</a> of law that they are the best person to take care of their child. <a href="/Emotion" title="Emotion">Emotion</a> (feelings) are a big part of the movie and the <a href="/Audience" title="Audience">audience</a> (people watching the movie) may get upset and even cry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b><a href="/Film_noir" title="Film noir">Film noir</a></b> movies are 1940s-era detective dramas about crime and violence.</li>
<li><b>Family</b> movies are made to be good for the entire family.

<li><b><a href="/Horror_movie" title="Horror movie">Horror movie</a></b>s use fear to excite the audience. Music, lighting and <a href="/Sets" title="Sets">sets</a> (man-made places in <a href="/Movie_studio" title="Movie studio">movie studios</a> where the movie is made) are all designed to add to the feeling.</li>
<li><b>Romantic Comedies</b> (Rom-Coms) are usually love stories about 2 people from different worlds, who must overcome obstacles to be together. Rom-Coms are always light-hearted, but may include some emotion.</li>
<li><b><a href="/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">Science fiction</a></b> movies are set in the future or in outer space. Some use their future or alien settings to ask questions about the <a href="/Meaning_of_life" title="Meaning of life">meaning of life</a> or <a href="/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">how we should think about life</a>. Science fiction movies often use <a href="/Special_effects" title="Special effects">special effects</a> to create images of alien worlds, outer space, alien creatures, and spaceships.</li>
<li><b>Thrillers</b> are usually about a mystery, strange event, or crime that needs to be solved. The audience is kept guessing until the final minutes, when there are usually 'twists' in the plot (surprises).</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_business_of_making_movies">The business of making movies</span></h2>
<p>Most movies lose money but some make profits in the hundreds of millions, be they dollars, euro or pounds. In <a href="/India" title="India">India</a> movies have become an enormous part of the economy. The industry has always been dominated by a few <a href="/Major_movie_studios" title="Major movie studios">major movie studios</a> like <a href="/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>/<a href="/United_Artists" title="United Artists">UA</a>, <a href="/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner</a>, <a href="/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia</a> or <a href="/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount</a>. There are many large companies that provide all of the services needed to make movies, such as <a href="/Special_effects" title="Special effects">special effects</a>, lighting, <a href="/Set_construction" title="Set construction">set building</a>. Many of these employees belong to <a href="/Trade_union" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> who say how much their members must be paid. A huge number of smaller companies also offer services, such as music studios (which record the music for original movie <a href="/Sound_track" title="Sound track">sound tracks</a>) and CGI <a href="/Computer_animation" title="Computer animation">computer animation</a>. Finally there are movie distribution companies (which send movies around the world or around a country), and advertising companies who let people know about the movie and promote it (try to make people want to see the movie).</p>
<p>Movies with famous <a href="/Movie_star" title="Movie star">stars</a> and large <a href="/Budget" title="Budget">budgets</a> (lots of money), are designed to have a wide appeal, so that hopefully millions of people will pay to see them. These most expensive movies are called <a href="/Blockbuster" title="Blockbuster">blockbusters</a>. <a href="/Special_effects" title="Special effects">Special effects</a> can add a huge amount to the cost of a movie, especially the newest <a href="/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">CGI</a> effects, but people have come to expect them and every blockbuster movie tries to out-do the last. Even in 2008, some movies cost up to $200 million to make. Very successful movies can make many times that amount in profit, and that's why the studios keep producing them. This kind of movie will have a lot of promotion through <a href="/Television" title="Television">television</a> <a href="/Advertising" title="Advertising">advertising</a>, <a href="/Billboard" title="Billboard">billboards</a> and <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">internet</a> sites. In blockbuster movies, there is usually a happy ending, in which all of the problems in the plot (story) are figured out or fixed and almost everyone (except the baddie) live happily ever after. Some movies have been so successful that the studios keep releasing more and more <a href="/Sequel" title="Sequel">sequels</a>, or movies with the same characters and basic plots.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the scale to the blockbuster, there is the independent, <a href="/Art_movie" title="Art movie">art</a>, or <a href="/Indie" title="Indie">Indie</a> movie. These are usually made by small movie companies, or even just a small group of people that do not have much money. An example is <a href="/The_Blair_Witch_Project" title="The Blair Witch Project">The Blair Witch Project</a>, which cost only about $60,000, but which has so far taken perhaps $200 million in ticket and DVD sales. Movies like this are very unusual and usually become popular 'underground' (<a href="/Word_of_mouth" title="Word of mouth">word of mouth</a> advertising), so that they become <a href="/Cult" title="Cult">cult</a>, or popular but not <a href="/Mainstream" title="Mainstream">mainstream</a>. Independent movies often tell more creative or unusual (strange) stories, or may have sad endings that do not appeal to the big studios, because they can not be sure how the public will react to them. They rarely make a lot of money, but if they are successful, the big studios will quickly try to get the people involved to sign a <a href="/Contract" title="Contract">contract</a> with them, by offering them a lot of money to make another movie. Often the new movie, with its big budget and its stars will be less successful than the first.</p>
