<p>Beijing simply means "the northern capital" in the <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a>.  It was once a counterpart of <a href="/Nanjing" title="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>, "the southern capital", during the Ming Dynasty.  This dynasty gave Beijing its name.

<p>The center of Beijing was settled in the <a href="/1st_millennium_BC" title="1st millennium BC">1st millennium BC</a>. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (燕, Yān) set up their capital where Beijing is today.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-CD_History"><a href="#_note-CD_History" title="">[1]</a></sup> They called it Ji (蓟, Jì). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.</p>

This city was destroyed by <a href="/Mongol" title="Mongol">Mongol</a> forces in <a href="/1215" title="1215">1215</a>.  Then in <a href="/1267" title="1267">1267</a>, Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it "Great Capital" (大都, Dàdū), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When <a href="/Kublai_Khan" title="Kublai Khan">Kublai Khan</a> the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.</p>
