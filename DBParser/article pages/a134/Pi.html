<p><b>Pi</b> (or <b>π</b>) is a <a href="/Mathematical_constant" title="Mathematical constant">mathematical constant</a>. It is the <a href="/Ratio" title="Ratio">ratio</a> of the distance around a <b><a href="/Circle" title="Circle">circle</a></b> to the circle's <b><a href="/Diameter" title="Diameter">diameter</a></b>. This produces a number, and that number is always the same. However, the number is rather strange. The number starts 3.141592....... and continues without end. Numbers like this are called <a href="/Irrational_number" title="Irrational number">irrational</a> numbers.</p>
<p>The diameter is the longest straight line which can be fitted inside a circle. It passes through the center of the circle. The distance around a circle is known as the <a href="/Circumference" title="Circumference">circumference</a>. Even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles, the number pi remains constant: its value never changes. This is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>
Pi is often written formally as <b><span class="math">\pi</span></b> or the Greek letter <b>π</b> as a shortcut.  Pi is also an <a href="/Irrational_number" title="Irrational number">irrational number</a>, meaning it cannot be written as a <a href="/Fraction_(mathematics)" title="Fraction (mathematics)">fraction</a> (<span class="math">a \over b</span>), where 'a' and 'b' are <a href="/Integer" title="Integer">integers</a> (whole numbers). This basically means that the digits of pi that are to the right of the <a href="/Decimal" title="Decimal">decimal</a> go <a href="/Infinity" title="Infinity">forever</a> without repeating in a pattern, and that it is impossible to write the exact value of pi as a number. Pi can only be <a href="/Approximated" title="Approximated">approximated</a>, or measured to a value that is close enough for practical purposes.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-About_Pi"><a href="#_note-About_Pi" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A value close to pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433... A common fraction approximation of pi is <span class="math">22 \over 7</span>, which yields approximately 3.14285714. This approximation is 0.04% away from the true value of pi. While this approximation is accepted for most of its use in real life, the fraction <span class="math">355 \over 113</span> is more accurate (giving about 3.14159292), and can be used when a value closer to pi is needed.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">Computers</a> can be used to get better approximations of pi.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The value of pi was known to Ancient Indian mathematicians like Bhaskaracharya and Aryabhatt.</p>
<p><a href="/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">Mathematicians</a> have known about pi for thousands of years because they have been working with circles for the same amount of time. <a href="/Civilizations" title="Civilizations">Civilizations</a> as old as the <a href="/Babylonia" title="Babylonia">Babylonians</a> have been able to approximate pi to many digits, such as the fraction 25/8 and 256/81. Most historians believe that <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptians</a> had no concept of π and that the correspondence is a coincidence.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-unleashed"><a href="#_note-unleashed" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first written reference to pi dates to 1900 BC.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Around 1650 BC the Egyptian Ahmes gave a value in the <i>Rhind Papyrus</i>. The Babylonians were able to find that the value of pi was slightly <a href="/Greater_than" title="Greater than">greater than</a> 3 by simply making a big circle and then sticking a piece of rope onto the circumference and the diameter, taking note of their distances, and then dividing the circumference by the diameter.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the number pi passed back into <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and into the hands of the <a href="/Hebrews" title="Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, who made the number important in a section of the <a href="/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> called the <a href="/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>. After this, the most common way of trying to find pi was to <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inscribe">draw</a> a shape of many sides inside any circle and use the <a href="/Area" title="Area">area</a> of the <a href="/Polygon" title="Polygon">shape</a> to find pi. The Greek philosopher <a href="/Archimedes" title="Archimedes">Archimedes</a>, for example, used a <a href="/Polygon" title="Polygon">polygon</a> shape that had 96 sides in order to find the value of pi, but the Chinese in 500 A.D. were able to use a polygon with 16,384 sides to find the value of pi. The Greeks, like <a href="/Anaxagoras" title="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a> of Clazomenae, were also busy with finding out other properties of the circle, such as how to make squares of circles and squaring the number pi. Since then, many people have been trying to find out more and more exact values of pi.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>



<p>In the 16th century, better and better ways of finding pi became available such as the complicated <a href="/Formula" title="Formula">formula</a> that the French lawyer François Viète developed. The first use of the Greek symbol "π" was in an essay written in 1706 by William Jones.</p>
<p>A <a href="/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> named Lambert also <a href="/Proved" title="Proved">showed</a> in 1761 that the number pi was <a href="/Irrational_number" title="Irrational number">irrational</a>; that is, it cannot be written as a fraction by normal standards. Another mathematician named Lindeman was also able to show in 1882 that pi was part of the group of numbers known as <a href="/Transcendentals" title="Transcendentals">transcendentals</a>, which are numbers that cannot be the solution to a <a href="/Polynomial" title="Polynomial">polynomial</a> equation.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pi can also be used for figuring out many other things beside circles.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-unleashed_b"><a href="#_note-unleashed" title="">[4]</a></sup> The properties of pi have allowed it to be used in many other areas of math besides <a href="/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, which studies shapes. Some of these areas are <a href="/Complex_analysis" title="Complex analysis">complex analysis</a>, <a href="/Trigonometry" title="Trigonometry">trigonometry</a>, and <a href="/Series_(mathematics)" title="Series (mathematics)">series</a>.</p>

<p>Today, there are different ways to calculate many digits of <span class="math">\pi</span>. This is of limited use though.</p>
<p>Pi can sometimes be used to work out the area or the circumference of any circle. To find the circumference of a circle, use the formula C (circumference) = π times <a href="/Diameter" title="Diameter">diameter</a>. To find the area of a circle, use the formula π (<a href="/Radius" title="Radius">radius</a>²). This formula is sometimes written as <span class="math">A = \pi r^2</span>, where <i>r</i> is the <a href="/Variable" title="Variable">variable</a> for the radius of any circle and <i>A</i> is the variable for the area of that circle.</p>
<p>To calculate the circumference of a circle with an error of 1 mm:
</p>
<ul>
<li>4 digits are needed for a radius of 30 meters</li>
<li>10 digits for a radius equal to that of the earth</li>
<li>15 digits for a radius equal to the distance from the earth to the sun.</li>
</ul>

<p>People generally celebrate March 14 as <a href="/Pi_Day" title="Pi Day">Pi Day</a> because March 14 is also written as 3/14, which represents the first three numbers 3.14 in the <a href="/Approximation" title="Approximation">approximation</a> of pi.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-About_Pi_b"><a href="#_note-About_Pi" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
