<li><a href="/Electronic_engineering" title="Electronic engineering">Electronic engineers</a> work with <a href="/Electronics" title="Electronics">electronics</a>, which are used to build computer parts and electrical equipment. </li>
<li><a href="/Environment" title="Environment">Environmental engineers</a> design and implement solutions to remediate and restore the environment. </li>
<li><a href="/Manufacturing_engineering" title="Manufacturing engineering">Manufacturing engineers</a> design and improve the machines and assembly lines that make things. They work with robots, hydraulics and air-operated devices to help companies work faster and better with fewer mistakes.</li>
<li><a href="/Mechanical_engineering" title="Mechanical engineering">Mechanical engineers</a> design machines or things that move, like cars and trains. A mechanical engineer also might help design electricity generating stations, oil refineries, and factories.</li>
<li><a href="/Mechatronics_engineering" title="Mechatronics engineering">Mechatronics engineers</a> work in multiple fields of engineering that include mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, <a href="/Telecommunication" title="Telecommunication">telecommunications</a> engineering, <a href="/Control_engineering" title="Control engineering">control engineering</a> and computer engineering. </li>
<li><a href="/Marine_Engineering" title="Marine Engineering">Marine Engineers</a> design, build, test and repair boats, ships, underwater craft, focusing primarily on their internal systems.  </li>
<li><a href="/Nanotechnology" title="Nanotechnology">Nanotechnology engineers</a> study very small things, like strings of atoms and how they are put together.</li>

<li><a href="/Software_engineering" title="Software engineering">Software engineers</a> design and write programs for computers.</li>
<li><a href="/Systems_engineering" title="Systems engineering">Systems engineers</a> look at how complicated things work and try to make them faster and smarter. </li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers do not only work with machines. They also work a lot with other people.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Many engineering projects are large and very complicated. Often <a href="/Interdisciplinarity" title="Interdisciplinarity">different kinds</a> of engineers work together and help each other. As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to build a computer. The computer needs programs written by software engineers. The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an airplane. An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Study">Study</span></h2>
<p>Most (but not all) engineers have had years of training. Much of their training involves working within a limited <a href="/Budget" title="Budget">budget</a> and materials.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="American_courses">American courses</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree. Most people go to school for four years to get a Bachelor's degree in engineering. A Master's Degree is an advanced degree, usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors. A person with a Master's degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering. A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a <a href="/Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="Doctor of Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree, which is commonly called a PhD. A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a Master's degree, and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation. After having gained enough work experience, one can sit for their Professional Engineer's (PE) License, reinforcing their demonstrated proficiency in their speciality.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="British_courses">British courses</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, engineering degrees at universities are either three year BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) or four year MEng (Master of Engineering). In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline (e.g. aeronautical or civil engineering) although some universities have a general engineering degree. British universities may also offer Doctoral programs as a doctor of philosophy (PhD) or a doctor of engineering (EngD).</p>
<p>Engineers can also get additional recognition in the form of becoming Chartered. A chartered engineer is one who has his degree or doctorate has been recognised by a group of professionals such as the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology), IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers), IChemE (Institution of Chemical Engineers) or ICE (Institution of Civil Engineers). Experience and responsibility enables a further step of recognition by becoming a Fellow of these institutions.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="French_courses">French courses</span></h3>
<p>The best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE (Classe Préparatoire pour les <a href="/Grande_%C3%A9cole" title="Grande école">Grandes Écoles</a> is the French class for engineer's school) for two years and then study for three years in an "École d'Ingénieur" (Engineer's school).
You can also study in an IUT (Institut universitaire technologique) for two years, and then study three years in an "École d'Ingénieur".</p>
