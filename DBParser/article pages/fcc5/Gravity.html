</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weight_vs_mass">Weight vs mass</span></h3>
<p>In everyday talk, we say things fall because the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s gravity pulls on them. We talk as if our <a href="/Weight" title="Weight">weight</a> was a "given". Actually, weight changes when the pull of gravity changes. The <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> is much smaller and the pull of gravity on the Moon is about 1/6th that of Earth. So any object on the Moon weighs 1/6th of its weight on Earth. What does not change is the amount of <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a> in an object. That is called its <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a>. On Earth, mass and weight are the same for practical purposes. The trip to the Moon shows they are not really the same.</p>
<p>From this we learn two things.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The &lt;u/l&gt;weight&lt;/u/l&gt; of an object is variable; its &lt;u/l&gt;mass&lt;/u/l&gt; is constant.</li>
<li>The pull of gravity varies according to the mass of an object. The Earth pulls more strongly than the Moon. A person also exerts a gravitational pull, but it is so tiny it can be ignored for all practical purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Earth has mass. Every <a href="/Particle" title="Particle">particle</a> of <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a> has mass. So the Earth pulls on every object and person, and they pull on the Earth. This pulling force is called "gravity" and it gives weight.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gravity_vs_gravitation">Gravity vs gravitation</span></h3>
<p>These words mean almost the same thing in everyday use. Sometimes scientists use "gravity" for the force that pulls objects towards each other, and "gravitation" for the theory about the attraction. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_gravitational_theory">History of gravitational theory</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Galileo">Galileo</span></h3>
<p>In the late 16th century, <a href="/Galileo" title="Galileo">Galileo</a> did a famous <a href="/Experiment" title="Experiment">experiment</a> about gravity where he dropped balls from the <a href="/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa" title="Leaning Tower of Pisa">Tower of Pisa</a>. He later rolled balls down inclines. With these experiments, Galileo showed that gravitation <a href="/Acceleration" title="Acceleration">accelerates</a> all objects at the same rate regardless of weight. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kepler">Kepler</span></h3>
<p><a href="/Johannes_Kepler" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> studied the motion of <a href="/Planet" title="Planet">planet</a>s. In 1609 and 1616 he published his three laws governing the shape of their orbits and their speed along those orbits, but did not discover why they moved that way. 
</p>


<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Newton">Newton</span></h3>
<p>In 1687, <a href="/England" title="England">English</a> <a href="/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a>  <a href="/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> wrote the <i><a href="/Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" title="Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Principia</a></i>. In this book, he wrote about the inverse-square law of gravitation. Newton said that the closer two objects are to each other, the more gravity will affect them. His theory about gravitation was used to predict the existence of the planet <a href="/Neptune_(planet)" title="Neptune (planet)">Neptune</a> based on changes in the orbit of <a href="/Uranus" title="Uranus">Uranus</a>.</p>
<p>Newton's theory was later used to predict the existence of another planet closer to the Sun than <a href="/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>. When this was done, it was learned that his theory was not entirely correct. These mistakes in his theory were corrected by <a href="/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s theory of General Relativity. Newton's theory is still commonly used for many things because it is much more simple to work with than the theory of General Relativity and is <a href="/Accuracy_and_precision" title="Accuracy and precision">accurate</a> enough for many uses.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dynamic_equilibrium">Dynamic equilibrium</span></h3>
<p>Why does the Earth not fall into the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>? The answer is simple but very important. It is because the Earth moving round the Sun is in a <a href="/Dynamic_equilibrium" title="Dynamic equilibrium">dynamic equilibrium</a>. The speed of the Earth's movement creates a <a href="/Centrifugal_force" title="Centrifugal force">centrifugal force</a> which balances the gravitational force between the Sun and the Earth. Why does the Earth continue spinning? Because there is no force to stop it.</p>
<p>Newton's first law: "If a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in motion it moves at the same <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velocity">speed</a> <i>until it is acted on by an external force</i>".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is a kind of analogy between <i>centrifugal force</i> and <i>gravitational force</i>, which led to the "equivalence principle" of <a href="/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Barbour"><a href="#_note-Barbour" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Eriksson"><a href="#_note-Eriksson" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Weightlessness">Weightlessness</span></h4>
<p>In <a href="/Free_fall" title="Free fall">free fall</a> an object's motion balances out the pull of gravity on it. This includes being in <a href="/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbit</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_relativity">General relativity</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/Special_theory_of_relativity" title="Special theory of relativity">special theory of relativity</a> describes systems where gravity is not an issue;  by contrast, gravity is the central issue of the <a href="/General_theory_of_relativity" title="General theory of relativity">general theory of relativity</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Wald"><a href="#_note-Wald" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In general relativity <i>there is no gravitational force</i> deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity is seen as changes in the properties of space and time. In turn, this changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. <a href="/Spacetime" title="Spacetime">Spacetime</a> tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Wheeler"><a href="#_note-Wheeler" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>For weak gravitational fields and slow speeds relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of <a href="/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation" title="Newton's law of universal gravitation">Newton's law of universal gravitation</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-W84"><a href="#_note-W84" title="">[7]</a></sup> Newton's equations are used to plan journeys in our Solar System.</p>
<p>General relativity has a number of physical consequences. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gravitational_time_dilation_and_frequency_shift">Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift</span></h3>


<p>Gravity influences the passage of time. Light sent down into a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_well">gravity well</a> is <a href="/Blueshift" title="Blueshift">blueshifted</a>, whereas light sent in the opposite direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is <a href="/Redshift" title="Redshift">redshifted</a>; collectively, these two effects are known as the <i>gravitational frequency shift</i>. </p>
<p>More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-M73"><a href="#_note-M73" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Light_deflection_and_gravitational_time_delay">Light deflection and gravitational time delay</span></h3>


<p>
General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant <a href="/Quasar" title="Quasar">quasars</a> being deflected as it passes the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ohan"><a href="#_note-Ohan" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A <a href="/Parameter" title="Parameter">parameter</a> called γ encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gravitational_waves">Gravitational waves</span></h3>
<p>{{main|gravitational wave}}
Gravitational waves are ripples in the <a href="/Curvature" title="Curvature">curvature</a> of <a href="/Spacetime" title="Spacetime">spacetime</a>. They move as a <a href="/Wave" title="Wave">wave</a>, travelling outward from the source. Einstein predicted them in 1915 on the basis of his theory of <a href="/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-14"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> In theory, gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation. Sources of detectable gravitational waves might include <a href="/Binary_star" title="Binary star">binary star</a> systems composed of <a href="/White_dwarf" title="White dwarf">white dwarfs</a>, <a href="/Neutron_star" title="Neutron star">neutron stars</a>, or <a href="/Black_holes" title="Black holes">black holes</a>. In general relativity, gravitational waves cannot travel faster than the <a href="/Speed_of_light" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>. </p>
<p>The 1993 <a href="/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor <a href="/Binary_star" title="Binary star">binary star</a> system. These measurements suggested gravitational waves are more than mathematical peculiarities. </p>
<p>On February 11, 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration teams announced that they had made the first observation of gravitational waves, originating from a pair of merging black holes using the Advanced LIGO detectors. On June 15, 2016, a second detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes was announced. Besides LIGO, many other gravitational-wave observatories (detectors) are under construction.</p>
