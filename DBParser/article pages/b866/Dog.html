<p><b>Dogs</b> (<i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>) are <a href="/Domestication" title="Domestication">domesticated</a> <a href="/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, not natural wild animals. They were originally <a href="/Artificial_selection" title="Artificial selection">bred</a> from <a href="/Wolf" title="Wolf">wolves</a>. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.  </p>
<p>Today,  some dogs are used as <a href="/Pet" title="Pet">pets</a>, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> are <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/register">registered</a> as <a href="/Pet" title="Pet">pets</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Dogs eat both <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a> and <a href="/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>, often mixed together and sold in stores as dog <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a>. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs.  </p>
<p>They are sometimes called "canines" from the <a href="/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a> word for dog - <i>canis</i>. Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other <a href="/Canid" title="Canid">canids</a>, such as <a href="/Wolf" title="Wolf">wolves</a>. A baby dog is called a <b>pup</b> or <b>puppy</b>. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old.</p>
<p>Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans. </p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance_and_behaviour">Appearance and behaviour</span></h2>
<p>Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs often chase <a href="/Cat" title="Cat">cats</a>, and most dogs will <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fetch">fetch</a> a ball or stick.</p>
<p>Dogs can smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well in <a href="/Color" title="Color">color</a> because they are <a href="/Color_blindness" title="Color blindness">color blind</a>. Due to the anatomy of the eye, dogs can see better in dim light than humans. They also have a wider field of vision. </p>
<p>Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called <a href="/Pack_(canine)" title="Pack (canine)">packs</a>. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the <a href="/Alpha_male" title="Alpha male">alpha male</a>. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male. {{fact|date=April 2014}}</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lifespan">Lifespan</span></h2>


<p>
Different dog breeds have different lifespans. In general, smaller dogs live longer than bigger ones.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The size and the breed of the dog change how long the dog lives, on average. Breeds such as the <a href="/Dachshund" title="Dachshund">Dachshund</a> usually live for fifteen years, <a href="/Chihuahua_(dog)" title="Chihuahua (dog)">Chihuahuas</a> can reach age twenty. The <a href="/Great_Dane" title="Great Dane">Great Dane</a>, on the other hand has an average lifespan of six to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for ten years.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_of_dogs">Origin of dogs</span></h2>
<p>All dogs are descended from <a href="/Wolf" title="Wolf">wolves</a>, by <a href="/Domestication" title="Domestication">domestication</a> and <a href="/Artificial_selection" title="Artificial selection">artificial selection</a>. This is known because <a href="/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> <a href="/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/analysis">analysis</a> has been done to discover this.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> They have been <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/breed">bred</a> by humans. The earliest known <a href="/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossil</a> of a domestic dog is from 31,700 years ago in <a href="/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Dogs have lived with people for at least 30,000 years. In 2013, a study was published that showed that the skull and teeth of a canid, dated to 33,000 years ago, had characteristics closer to a dog than to a wolf, and the authors conclude that "this specimen may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication, i.e. an “incipient” dog."  The researchers go on to suggest that it was, however, a line that did not lead to modern dogs.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Genetically, this material is closer to that of a modern dog than to that of a wolf.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Druzhkova"><a href="#_note-Druzhkova" title="">[7]</a></sup> Other signs of domestication are that sometimes, dogs were buried together with humans.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Evidence of this is a tomb in <a href="/Bonn" title="Bonn">Bonn</a>, where a man of about 50 years of age, a woman of about 25 years of age, the remains of a dog, plus other <a href="/Artifact_(archaeology)" title="Artifact (archaeology)">artifacts</a> were found. <a href="/Radiocarbon_dating" title="Radiocarbon dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> showed that the human bones were between 13.300 and 14.000 years old.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dogs_and_humans">Dogs and humans</span></h2>
<p>Dogs are often called "man's best <a href="/Friend" title="Friend">friend</a>" because they fit in with human life. Man refers to humankind and not just guys (<a href="/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a>). Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are <a href="/Guard_dog" title="Guard dog">guard dogs</a>, <a href="/Hunting_dog" title="Hunting dog">hunting dogs</a>, <a href="/Sheepdog" title="Sheepdog">herding dogs</a>, <a href="/Guide_dog" title="Guide dog">guide dogs</a> for <a href="/Blind" title="Blind">blind</a> people, and <a href="/Police_dog" title="Police dog">police dogs</a>. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or <a href="/Illegal_drugs" title="Illegal drugs">illegal drugs</a>. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually <a href="/Beagle" title="Beagle">beagles</a>) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russians</a> into <a href="/Outer_space" title="Outer space">outer space</a>, a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was named <a href="/Laika" title="Laika">Laika</a>, but she died within a few hours.&lt;gallery&gt;

<p>There are at least 800 <a href="/List_of_dog_breeds" title="List of dog breeds">breeds</a> (kinds) of dogs. Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed: these dogs are called <a href="/Purebred" title="Purebred">purebred</a> or pure <a href="/Pedigree" title="Pedigree">pedigree</a> dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called <i>mutts</i>, <i><a href="/Mixed-breed_dog" title="Mixed-breed dog">mixed-breed dogs</a></i>, <i><a href="/Hybrid" title="Hybrid">hybrids</a></i>, or <i>mongrels</i>. Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs, collies, <a href="/Poodle" title="Poodle">poodles</a> and retrievers. It is becoming popular to breed together two different breeds of dogs and call the new dog's breed a name that is a mixture of the parents' breeds' two names. A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo. These kinds of dogs, instead of being called mutts, are known as designer dog breeds. These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows.
They can be guide dogs.</p>
