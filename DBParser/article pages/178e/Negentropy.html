<p><b>Negentropy</b> is reverse <a href="/Entropy" title="Entropy">entropy</a>. It means things becoming more in order. By 'order' is meant organisation, <a href="/Structure" title="Structure">structure</a> and <a href="/Function" title="Function">function</a>: the opposite of <a href="/Randomness" title="Randomness">randomness</a> or <a href="/Chaos" title="Chaos">chaos</a>. One example of negentropy is a star system such as the <a href="/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a>. Another example is <a href="/Life" title="Life">life</a>.</p>
<p>As a general rule, everything in the <a href="/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a> tends towards <a href="/Entropy" title="Entropy">entropy</a>. <a href="/Star_system" title="Star system">Star systems</a> eventually become dead. All energy has gone, and everything in the system is <i>at the temperature of the surrounding space</i>. The opposite of entropy is negentropy. It is a <a href="/Temporary" title="Temporary">temporary</a> condition in which certain things are hotter and more highly organised than the surrounding space. This is the <a href="/Second_law_of_thermodynamics" title="Second law of thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a>:

<dd>The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated <a href="/System" title="System">system</a> always increases over time.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>

<p><a href="/Life" title="Life">Life</a> is considered to be <b>negentropic</b> because it takes things in which have less order, like dead <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a>, and turns it into things with more order, like <a href="/Cell" title="Cell">cells</a> in the <a href="/Body" title="Body">body</a>, <a href="/Tissue_(biological)" title="Tissue (biological)">tissues</a>, and <a href="/Organ_(anatomy)" title="Organ (anatomy)">organs</a>. In doing so, it gives off <a href="/Heat" title="Heat">heat</a>.  Another example of negentropic things are <a href="/Society" title="Society">societies</a>, or social <a href="/Systems_theory" title="Systems theory">systems</a>, because they take disorderly things such as <a href="/Communication" title="Communication">communications</a>, and make them into order which is useful to people.</p>
