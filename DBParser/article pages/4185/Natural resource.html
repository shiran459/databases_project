<p>A <b>natural resource</b> is anything that people can use which comes from the <a href="/Natural_environment" title="Natural environment">natural environment</a>.  People do not make natural resources, but gather them.  Examples of natural resources are <a href="/Air" title="Air">air</a>, <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>, <a href="/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a>, <a href="/Crude_oil" title="Crude oil">oil</a>, <a href="/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind energy</a>,  <a href="/Iron" title="Iron">iron</a>, and <a href="/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>. Refined oil and <a href="/Hydro-electric_energy" title="Hydro-electric energy">hydro-electric energy</a> are not natural resources because people make them.</p>

<p>We often say there are two sorts of natural resources: renewable resources and non-renewable resources.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="/Renewable_resource" title="Renewable resource">renewable resource</a> is one which can be used again and again. For example, <a href="/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a>, <a href="/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> and <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> are renewable resources. However, in some circumstances, even water is not renewable easily. <a href="/Wood" title="Wood">Wood</a> is a renewable resource, but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else. Soil, if it blows away, is not easy to renew.</li>
<li>A <a href="/Non-renewable_resource" title="Non-renewable resource">non-renewable resource</a> is a resource that does not grow and come back, or a resource that would take a very long time to come back. For example, <a href="/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> is a non-renewable resource. When we use coal, there is less coal afterward. One day, there will be no more of it to make <a href="/Product_(consumer_goods)" title="Product (consumer goods)">goods</a>. The non-renewable resource can be used directly (for example, burning oil to cook), or we can find a renewable resource to use (for example, using wind energy to make <a href="/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> to cook).  </li>
</ul>


<p>
Most natural resources are limited. This means they will eventually run out. A perpetual resource has a never-ending supply. Some examples of perpetual resources include <a href="/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a>, <a href="/Tidal_energy" title="Tidal energy">tidal energy</a>, and <a href="/Wind_energy" title="Wind energy">wind energy</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Some of the things influencing supply of resources include whether it is able to be <a href="/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycled</a>, and the availability of suitable substitutes for the material.  Non-renewable resources cannot be recycled.  For example, <a href="/Fossil_fuel" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> cannot be recycled.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Demand">Demand</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/Demand" title="Demand">demand</a> for resources can change with new <a href="/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a>, new needs, and new <a href="/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a> (e.g. changes in cost of the resources). Some material can go completely out of use, if people do not want it any more. Demand of many natural resources is very high, but availability of some, such as <a href="/Precious_metal" title="Precious metal">precious metals</a>, is very low. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Availability">Availability</span></h2>
<p>All places have their own natural resources.When people do not have a certain resource they need, they can either replace it with another resource, or <a href="/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a> with another country to get the resource. People have sometimes <a href="/War" title="War">fought</a> to have them (for example, <a href="/Spice" title="Spice">spices</a>, water, arable land, <a href="/Gold" title="Gold">gold</a>, or <a href="/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>).</p>
<p>When people do not have some natural resources, their quality of life can get lower. So, we need to protect our resources from pollution. For example, when they can not get clean water, people may become <a href="/Disease" title="Disease">ill</a>; if there is not enough wood, trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time (<a href="/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a>); if there are not enough fish in a sea, people can die of <a href="/Starvation" title="Starvation">starvation</a>.  Renewable resources include <a href="/Crop" title="Crop">crops</a>, wind, hydroelectric power, fish, and sunlight. Many people carefully save their natural resources so that others can use them in future.</p>
