<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The history of the city goes back to the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. The Romans started a military camp called Vindobona.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The camp was in today's first district on the <a href="/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> river. The name came from the <a href="/Celts" title="Celts">Celts</a>, so there was probably a Celtic settlement before the Roman invasion. The Romans stayed until the 5th century. In <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">medieval times</a>, the settlement was still in use. The present name was mentioned in 881 in the <a href="/Salzburg" title="Salzburg">Salzburger</a> Annalen, where a battle <i>ad weniam</i> is mentioned.</p>
<p>In 976 the House of Babenberg became rulers of the area. They made Vienna their capital in 1155. Vienna was already an important city. In 1156, Austria became a <a href="/Duchy" title="Duchy">Duchy</a>, and Vienna was where the <a href="/Duke" title="Duke">Duke</a> who ruled the Duchy lived. In 1221, Vienna got municipal rights.  It Is the second oldest city in Austria (<a href="/Enns" title="Enns">Enns</a>, in <a href="/Upper_Austria" title="Upper Austria">Upper Austria</a>, is the oldest).</p>
<p>In 1278, the Duchy came to the <a href="/Habsburg" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> family. Rudolf IV started the university in 1365 and while he was duke the nave of the Gothic St. Stephan's Cathedral was built. Quarrels within the Hapsburg family caused an economic decline in Vienna. In 1438, Vienna became the residence of the Holy Roman Emperor.</p>
<p>During the time of the <a href="/Reformation" title="Reformation">reformation</a> Vienna was a Protestant city, but in the times of the Counter Reformation, Austria and Vienna were mostly Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>In 1529, Vienna was first besieged by the army of the <a href="/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, which had a border only 150 km east of Vienna. This hurt Vienna <a href="/Economics" title="Economics">economically</a>, but led to people <a href="/Fort" title="Fort">fortifying</a> the city (making it stronger). After a second siege, the Ottoman Empire could not take Vienna, and the city started getting larger.</p>

After 1858 the walls of the city were destroyed and the <a href="/Ringstra%C3%9Fe" title="Ringstraße">Ringstraße</a> replaced them. Along that street houses of the rich citizens were built, as were public buildings like the city hall and the Burg theatre. The industrialisation started at the beginning of the century and made more people live there. In 1870, Vienna had one million people, and in 1910, two million people. With the creation of a large working class and poverty in Vienna the Labour Party (Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei) became stronger.</p>
<p>Karl Lueger was the most important mayor in the time of Emperor Franz Josef. During his time important community plans were realized that made Vienna a modern city. However, Lueger was a radical anti-Semite. He was admired by the young <a href="/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, who spent some years before the First World War in Vienna. At this time, Vienna was an important place for the arts.

<p>After the end of the <a href="/First_World_War" title="First World War">First World War</a> the Austrian-Hungary Empire was dissolved and Vienna became capital of the Republic of Austria. In 1938, Austria was occupied by Germany. In Vienna the suffering of the Jewish inhabitants began. A lot of their properties was given to Austrians (Arisierung). </p>
<p>After the <a href="/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, which destroyed 20% of Vienna's buildings, Vienna was divided into four parts. The city was controlled by the allies like the other parts of <a href="/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>. In 1955 the state treaty between the allies and Austria was signed in Vienna's Belvedere.
