A <b>wave</b> is a kind of <a href="/Oscillation" title="Oscillation">oscillation</a> (disturbance) that travels through <a href="/Space" title="Space">space</a> and <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a>. Wave motions transfer <a href="/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> from one place to another.</p>

<p>
Waves have <a href="/Properties" title="Properties">properties</a> that can be <a href="/Measure" title="Measure">measured</a>. All waves can be pictured by adding <a href="/Sine_wave" title="Sine wave">sine waves</a>.</p>
<p>Sine waves can be measured too. The shape of a sine wave is given by its <a href="/Amplitude" title="Amplitude">amplitude</a>, <a href="/Phase" title="Phase">phase</a>, <a href="/Wavelength" title="Wavelength">wavelength</a> and <a href="/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequency</a>. The <a href="/Speed" title="Speed">speed</a> that the sine wave moves can be measured. The amplitude and wavelength of the sine wave is shown in the picture.</p>
<p>The highest point on a wave is called the peak. The lowest point is called the trough. The peak of a wave and the trough of a wave are always twice the wave's amplitude apart from each other. The part of the wave half way in between the peak and the trough is called the baseline.</p>
<p>Complicated wave forms (like the sound waves of music) can be made by adding up sine waves of different frequencies. This is how mp3 audio files are converted from their compressed form into music we can hear.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Waves_and_matter">Waves and matter</span></h2>
<p>Some waves can move through <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a> while others cannot. For instance, some waves can move through empty <a href="/Space_(physics)" title="Space (physics)">space</a>, <a href="/Light_wave" title="Light wave">light waves</a> for example. Sound waves, on the other hand, cannot move through empty space. Inherently, all waves carry <a href="/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> from one place to another when they move. In some applications of technology, waves may carry meaningful <a href="/Information" title="Information">information</a> from one place to another, such as news on the radio. </p>
<p>Usually, after a wave moves through matter, the matter is the same as it was before the wave was introduced, though in some cases, matter can be affected by waves traveling through it. In 1922, Louis de Broglie found out that all waves are also <a href="/Particles" title="Particles">particles</a>, and all particles are also waves.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types">Types</span></h2>
<p>In matter:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Transverse_wave" title="Transverse wave">Transverse wave</a>: the <a href="/Vibration" title="Vibration">vibrations</a> of <a href="/Particle" title="Particle">particles</a> are <a href="/Perpendicular" title="Perpendicular">perpendicular</a> ‚ä• to the direction of travel of the wave. Transverse waves have <a href="/Crest" title="Crest">crests</a> and <a href="/Trough" title="Trough">troughs</a>. Wave crests and troughs move along a travelling transverse wave.</li>
<li><a href="/Longitudinal_wave" title="Longitudinal wave">Longitudinal wave</a>: the vibrations of particles are parallel to the direction of travel of wave. Longitudinal waves have <a href="/Compression" title="Compression">compressions</a> and <a href="/Rarefaction" title="Rarefaction">rarefactions</a>. Compressions and rarefactions move along a travelling longitudinal wave.</li>
<li><a href="/Standing_wave" title="Standing wave">Standing wave</a>: a wave that remains in a constant position.</li>
<li><a href="/Travelling_wave" title="Travelling wave">Travelling wave</a>: The blue waves move off to the right. They are traveling waves. The red waves do not move. They are standing waves.</li>
<li><a href="/Solitary_wave" title="Solitary wave">Solitary wave</a>: Solitary waves are hard to explain. They were first observed in a river channel in 1834. Something gets a bulge of water starting moving up the channel and the bulge on the surface of the water continues to move up the stream. At first, physicists did not believe the story they heard from the man  who observed it.</li>
<li><a href="/Light_wave" title="Light wave">Light waves</a> can move through <a href="/Space_(physics)" title="Space (physics)">space</a>. Light is different from wind or water because light sometimes acts like waves and sometimes it acts as little bits called "<a href="/Particles" title="Particles">particles</a>." The nature of light is a big part of <a href="/Quantum_mechanics" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.</li>
