<p>Many coins have unique or complicated <a href="/Decorations" title="Decorations">decorations</a>; one side often has the picture of a famous or important person's <a href="/Head" title="Head">head</a> on it. </p>
<p>The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things <a href="/Random" title="Random">randomly</a>. This is called "tossing a coin".  A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it.  You then look at which side is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called "heads", if the other side is facing up it is called "tails". Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means. Tossing a coin can be a type of <a href="/Gambling" title="Gambling">gambling</a>, which is <a href="/Illegal" title="Illegal">illegal</a> (against the law) in some <a href="/Country" title="Country">countries</a>.</p>

Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They can be much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like <a href="/Copper" title="Copper">copper</a>. Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.</p>
