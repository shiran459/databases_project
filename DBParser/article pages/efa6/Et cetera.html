<p><b>Et cetera</b> means "and the rest" in <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>. It is often used in <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> to continue a <a href="/List" title="List">list</a> that is longer than what can be normally written. People most often write "et cetera" as <b>etc.</b>. Very rarely, it is also written "&amp;c" because the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ampersand">ampersand</a>, or the "&amp;", is the same as "et", having been formed by  'e' and 't' being <a href="/Ligature_(typography)" title="Ligature (typography)">joined</a> into a single letter. It is also the symbol for "and". Some people write it as "ect", but that is wrong since it incorrectly abbreviates "et cetera".</p>
