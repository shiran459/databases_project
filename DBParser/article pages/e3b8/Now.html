<p><b>Now</b> is the <a href="/Time_span" title="Time span">time span</a> between the <a href="/Past" title="Past">past</a> and the <a href="/Future" title="Future">future</a>. It can be long (like an <a href="/Eon" title="Eon">eon</a> in <a href="/Geologic_time" title="Geologic time">geologic time</a>) or short (like a <a href="/Picosecond" title="Picosecond">picosecond</a>) but it is almost always used to refer to the span between the present instant to some <a href="/Time_horizon" title="Time horizon">time horizon</a> when a <a href="/Choice" title="Choice">decision</a> must be made. It can be used to ask or demand that someone make a decision even if they want to delay.</p>
<p>"I want to know what you think, now."</p>
<p>"What do you think now?"</p>
<p>"Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country."</p>
<p><a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> and <a href="/Measurement" title="Measurement">measurement</a> assume that everything used in one <a href="/Equation" title="Equation">equation</a> <a href="/Equals" title="Equals">equals</a> the same quantities at the beginning of <a href="/Calculation" title="Calculation">calculation</a> or <a href="/Axiomatization" title="Axiomatization">axiomatization</a> as at the end. That means it is mathematically correct to say that the idea of "<a href="/Equal" title="Equal">equal</a>" means "equal from the time the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/process">process</a> starts to the time it ends." In <a href="/General_Semantics" title="General Semantics">General Semantics</a> and <a href="/E_Prime" title="E Prime">E Prime</a> the words <a href="/Equal" title="Equal">equal</a>, <a href="/Remain" title="Remain">remain</a> (for the past until <b>now</b>) and <a href="/Become" title="Become">become</a> (for <b>now</b> into the future) replace the <a href="/Verb" title="Verb">verb</a> "<a href="/To_be" title="To be">to be</a>" for this reason.</p>
<p><a href="/Algebra" title="Algebra">Algebra</a> is now often called <b>snapshot algebra</b> or <b>algebra of seeing</b> because of this dependence on time. If any <a href="/Action" title="Action">action</a> or <a href="/Event" title="Event">event</a> were possible between steps in algebraic analysis, then, in theory, one would have to start over as if one had no knowledge of the new state at all. For these reasons the idea of <a href="/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a> and also <a href="/Knowledge" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> and <a href="/Knowledge_management" title="Knowledge management">knowledge management</a> are sometimes questioned, for instance, in the book <i><a href="/Lies%2C_Damn_Lies%2C_and_Statistics" title="Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics">Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics</a></i>. A major issue is the comparing of numbers gathered in the past, and <b>now</b>, after some key conditions change.</p></div>
