<p>
In the past, people built <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hut">huts</a> and wood <a href="/House" title="House">houses</a> to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great <a href="/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilizations</a> like the <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptians</a> built large <a href="/Temples" title="Temples">temples</a> and structures, like the <a href="/Great_Pyramids_of_Giza" title="Great Pyramids of Giza">Great Pyramids of Giza</a>. The <a href="/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">Ancient Greeks</a> and <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> made what we now call "<a href="/Classical_Architecture" title="Classical Architecture">Classical Architecture</a>". The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the <a href="/Arch" title="Arch">arch</a> from the <a href="/Etruscans" title="Etruscans">Etruscans</a>, who copied it from the <a href="/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamians</a>. The <a href="/Stone" title="Stone">stone</a> <a href="/Column" title="Column">columns</a>, which still hold up so many important buildings, like the <a href="/Parthenon" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> in <a href="/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, were simply copied from the first wooden posts.</p>


<p>
<b>Classical Architecture</b> was very formal, and it always obeyed <a href="/Laws" title="Laws">laws</a>. It used <a href="/Symmetry" title="Symmetry">symmetry</a>, which really means <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simple:balance">balance</a>, and it used <a href="/Proportion" title="Proportion">proportion</a> which means keeping shapes in certain ways. The <a href="/Golden_ratio" title="Golden ratio">Golden Mean</a> was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched <a href="/Bridge" title="Bridge">bridge</a> needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of <a href="/Year" title="Year">years</a> of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, like <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, the architecture is famous for <a href="/Carving" title="Carving">carving</a> the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, Southeast Asia, <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and Central and <a href="/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.</p>
<p>Later, people in <a href="/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> in the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> made <a href="/Romanesque_architecture" title="Romanesque architecture">Romanesque architecture</a>, then <a href="/Gothic_architecture" title="Gothic architecture">Gothic architecture</a>.  Gothic buildings have tall, pointed <a href="/Window" title="Window">windows</a> and arches.  Many <a href="/Church" title="Church">churches</a> have Gothic architecture. <a href="/Castle" title="Castle">Castles</a> were also built at this time. In <a href="/Eastern_Europe" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, churches usually had <a href="/Dome" title="Dome">domes</a>. People added their own ideas and <a href="/Decoration" title="Decoration">decoration</a> to the Classical Architecture of the past.  The <a href="/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> brought a return to classical ideas. 
</p>


<p>
In the late 18th century with the <a href="/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, people began to <a href="/Invent" title="Invent">invent</a> machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many <a href="/Factory" title="Factory">factories</a> and <a href="/Mill_(factory)" title="Mill (factory)">mills</a> were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the <a href="/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a>, architects like <a href="/George_Fowler_Jones" title="George Fowler Jones">George Fowler Jones</a> and <a href="/Decimus_Burton" title="Decimus Burton">Decimus Burton</a> still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and <a href="/Masonry" title="Masonry">masonry</a> used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in <a href="/Ulm" title="Ulm">Ulm</a>, Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse, an example of which is the <a href="/Beauvais_Cathedral" title="Beauvais Cathedral">Beauvais Cathedral</a>, which was never completed. 
</p>


<p>Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, <a href="/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a> became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and <a href="/Reinforced_concrete" title="Reinforced concrete">reinforced concrete</a> to build. An example is the <a href="/Eiffel_Tower" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> in <a href="/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them <a href="/Skyscrapers" title="Skyscrapers">skyscrapers</a>. This new <a href="/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a> has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.</p>
<p><a href="/Modernism" title="Modernism">Modernism</a> is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called "post-modern".</p>
<p>Many of the world's greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as <a href="/Frank_Lloyd_Wright" title="Frank Lloyd Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, <a href="/I._M._Pei" title="I. M. Pei">I. M. Pei</a>, <a href="/Adrian_Smith_(architect)" title="Adrian Smith (architect)">Adrian Smith</a>, <a href="/Edward_Durell_Stone" title="Edward Durell Stone">Edward Durell Stone</a>, <a href="/Frank_Gehry" title="Frank Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>, <a href="/Fazlur_Khan" title="Fazlur Khan">Fazlur Khan</a>, <a href="/Gottfried_B%C3%B6hm" title="Gottfried Böhm">Gottfried Böhm</a>, and <a href="/Bruce_Graham" title="Bruce Graham">Bruce Graham</a>.</p>
