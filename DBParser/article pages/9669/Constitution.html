<p>The <b>constitution</b> of a <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a> (or a <a href="/State" title="State">state</a>) is a special type of <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a> <a href="/Document" title="Document">document</a> that tells how its <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> is supposed to work.

<p>Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution <i>(see <a href="/Rule_of_Law" title="Rule of Law">Rule of Law</a> )</i>.

Because of this, some people say that the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> has a <i><a href="/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> or "unwritten" constitution.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p> 
<p>The <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions.
