<p>A <b>microscope</b> is a <a href="/Science" title="Science">scientific</a> <a href="/Tool" title="Tool">instrument</a>. It makes small objects look larger. This lets people see the small things. People who use microscopes commonly in their jobs include <a href="/Medical_doctor" title="Medical doctor">doctors</a> and <a href="/Scientist" title="Scientist">scientists</a>. <a href="/Student" title="Student">Student</a>s in science classes such as <a href="/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> or <a href="/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> also use microscopes to study small things.</p>
<p>The earliest microscopes had only one <a href="/Lens_(optics)" title="Lens (optics)">lens</a> and are called <i>simple microscopes</i>. <i>Compound microscopes</i> have at least two lenses. In a compound microscope, the lens closer to the eye is called the <i>eyepiece</i>. The lens at the other end is called the <i>objective</i>. The lenses multiply up, so a 10x eyepiece and a 40x objective together give 400x magnification. </p>
<p>Microscopes make things seem larger than they are, to about 1000 times larger. This is much stronger than a <a href="/Magnifying_glass" title="Magnifying glass">magnifying glass</a> which works as a simple microscope.</p>

<p>There are many different types of microscopes. The most common are compound <a href="/Light_microscope" title="Light microscope">light microscopes</a> and <a href="/Electron_microscopes" title="Electron microscopes">electron microscopes</a>. In a compound light microscope, the object is <a href="/Lighting" title="Lighting">illuminated</a>: light is thrown on it. The image formed by the object is looked at. Light passes through two lenses and makes the image bigger. </p>
<p><a href="/Electron_microscope" title="Electron microscope">Electron microscopes</a> come in different types. <a href="/Electron_microscope#Transmission_electron_microscopes_.28TEM.29" title="Electron microscope">Transmission electron microscopes</a> (TEMs) fire <a href="/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a> into the object being looked at. This carries information about how the object looks into a magnetic "lens". The image is then magnified onto a <a href="/Television_screen" title="Television screen">television screen</a>. <a href="/Scanning_electron_microscope" title="Scanning electron microscope">Scanning electron microscopes</a> also fire electrons at the object, but in a single beam. These lose their power when they strike the object, and the loss of power results in something else being generatedâ€”usually an <a href="/X-ray" title="X-ray">X-ray</a>. This is sensed and magnified onto a screen.</p>
