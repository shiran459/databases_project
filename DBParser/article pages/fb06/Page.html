<p>A <b>page</b> can be different things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Usually, a <b>page</b> is a <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">physical</a> sheet of <a href="/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a> in a <a href="/Book" title="Book">book</a>, <a href="/Magazine" title="Magazine">magazine</a>, <a href="/Newspaper" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> etc. When a page is not in a book (etc.) it is a <i>sheet</i> or <i>piece</i> of paper.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>When we talk about computers, a <b>page</b> is also a common <a href="/Abbreviation" title="Abbreviation">abbreviation</a> in <a href="/Net_jargon" title="Net jargon">net jargon</a> for "<a href="/Webpage" title="Webpage">webpage</a>".  Here the page is not paper, it is a piece of information which we can see on a <a href="/Computer_monitor" title="Computer monitor">computer monitor</a> at one time.  We can <a href="/Printing" title="Printing">print</a> it to make a real page.  But the information may not fit all on one page, and we can not change it when it is printed - we can change a web page.  So a webpage is not always the same even as a printed copy of that page.  This is a <a href="/Conceptual_metaphor" title="Conceptual metaphor">conceptual metaphor</a>.  It can be confusing.  Someone who uses it is also likely to use other <a href="/Jargon" title="Jargon">jargon</a>.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>A <b>page</b> is also a boy or a young man who helps carry things and does small jobs for someone. Another word for this is a <i>pageboy</i>. </li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><b>To page</b> someone is to contact that person on their <i>pager</i>: this is a small electronic machine which makes a sound or gives someone a message.</li>
</ul>
