<p>In <a href="/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, <b>perimeter</b> is the distance around a flat object.  For example, all four sides of a square <a href="/Rhombus" title="Rhombus">rhombus</a> have the same length, so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches (2+2+2+2=8).</p>
<p>Real-life objects have perimeters as well.  A <a href="/Football" title="Football">football</a> field, including the end zones, is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide.  So the perimeter of the field is 360+160+360+160=1040 feet.</p>
<p>The perimeter of a circle is usually called the <a href="/Circumference" title="Circumference">circumference</a>. It may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times "Pi". Pi is a constant which is equal to 3.14159; however, the places to the right of the decimal are endless. The number of places used depend on the accuracy required for the result.</p>
