<p>Denmark was first united in the <a href="/10th_century" title="10th century">10th century</a>, during the <a href="/Viking" title="Viking">Viking</a> period, by the king Harald Bluetooth ({{circa|985}}), who first converted Denmark to <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. The Vikings are well known for invading countries.  In the <a href="/11th_century" title="11th century">11th century</a>, the Danish Vikings controlled <a href="/England" title="England">England</a> (the <a href="/Danelaw" title="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>) for a while. In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the <i>Kalmar Union</i>) Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called <i>Denmark-Norway)</i> stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the <a href="/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, including the <a href="/Faroe_Islands" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, <a href="/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>. Iceland became <a href="/Independent" title="Independent">independent</a> from Denmark in 1944.</p>


<p>
Denmark became a <a href="/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> in <a href="/June_5" title="June 5">June 5</a>, <a href="/1849" title="1849">1849</a> when it adopted a <a href="/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a> which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people. <a href="/June_5" title="June 5">June 5</a> is  now a holiday in Denmark, called "Constitution Day".</p>
<p>Over the years Denmark lost many of the lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the <i>Second Schleswig War</i> (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was conquered by the Kingdom <a href="/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a> (now a part of <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of <a href="/Neutrality_(international_relations)" title="Neutrality (international relations)">neutrality</a> after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the <a href="/First_World_War" title="First World War">First World War</a>. </p>
<p>On <a href="/April_9" title="April 9">April 9</a>, <a href="/1940" title="1940">1940</a>, Denmark was invaded by <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. During the war, in 1943, Danes helped over 8,000 <a href="/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a> to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them. </p>
<p>After the liberation of Denmark, one part of the country was not. That was the island of <a href="/Bornholm" title="Bornholm">Bornholm</a>. The German Commandant <i>von Kamptz</i> who was stationed there, refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden. The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns <a href="/R%C3%B8nne" title="Rønne">Rønne</a> and <a href="/Nex%C3%B8" title="Nexø">Nexø</a>. After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946.</p>
<p>After World War Two, Denmark became a member of <a href="/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a> and the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the <i>Kingdom of Denmark</i> and have their own governments and limited power.</p>

<p>
Denmark has three branches of power; the <a href="/Judiciary" title="Judiciary">judiciary</a> (the courts), the executive (the Prime Minister and the cabinet) and the <a href="/Legislature" title="Legislature">legislature</a> (the <a href="/Folketing" title="Folketing">Danish parliament</a>). The current Prime Minister of Denmark is <a href="/Lars_L%C3%B8kke_Rasmussen" title="Lars Løkke Rasmussen">Lars Løkke Rasmussen</a>, who was <a href="/Election" title="Election">elected</a> in June 2015.</p>
<p>Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a <a href="/Monarchy" title="Monarchy">monarch</a> (a king or queen). The current monarch is Queen <a href="/Margrethe_II_of_Denmark" title="Margrethe II of Denmark">Margrethe II</a>. Margrethe II does not have a lot of power (she does not make any important decisions) and has a symbolic role. Denmark became a <a href="/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> in 1849.</p>
<p>Elections to the <a href="/Folketing" title="Folketing">parliament</a> are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a <a href="/Coalition" title="Coalition">coalition</a> <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a>, and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister.</p>

</p>


<p>
Denmark is the smallest of the <a href="/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> countries. The neighbours are <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> (to the south), <a href="/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> (to the east), <a href="/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> (to the north) and the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland (<i>Jylland</i>), the largest part of Denmark. It is connected to Germany by land. To the south-east there is the <a href="/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, to the west the <a href="/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, to the north the <a href="/Skagerrak" title="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> and to the north-east the <a href="/Kattegat" title="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>.</p>
<p>The western part of Denmark is the <a href="/Peninsula" title="Peninsula">peninsula</a> of <a href="/Jutland" title="Jutland">Jutland</a> ({{lang-da|Jylland}}, pronounced <i>yoo´-land</i>), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. The largest islands are Zealand (<i>Sjælland</i>), and Funen (<i>Fyn</i>). To the east is the island of <a href="/Bornholm" title="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> in the <a href="/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen.</p>
<p>The country is quite flat. The highest hill or mountain is Møllehøj, which is 170.86 metres (560.56 ft) tall.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland. Denmark's shore line covers 7,314 km (4,545 mi).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Nobody in Denmark lives more than 60 km from the coast.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a> in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the <a href="/Winter" title="Winter">winter</a>, it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of <a href="/Snow" title="Snow">snow</a>. Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The <a href="/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> and <a href="/Topography" title="Topography">topography</a> are not good for winter sports.</p>
<p>Most <a href="/Summer" title="Summer">summers</a> are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Regions_and_municipalities">Regions and municipalities</span></h3>


<p>
Denmark is divided into five regions (<a href="/Danish_language" title="Danish language">Danish</a>: <i>regioner</i> or <i>region</i> for one). The regions replaced the former counties (<i>amter</i>) in January 2007. The regions are in charge of hospitals and health care.</p>



<p>The regions are then subdivided into municipalities ({{lang-da|kommuner}}). There are currently 98 municipalities, but before January 2007 there were 275. The number of municipalities was decreased when it was decided that, to become more efficient, each should have a population of at least 20,000 .</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="People">People</span></h2>


<p>
The biggest part (90.5%) of Denmark's population of just under 5.4 million is of Danish descent, according to 2009 statistics. Of the rest 8.9% who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants, many come from <a href="/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> or the <a href="/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>. There are also small groups of <a href="/Inuit" title="Inuit">Inuit</a> from <a href="/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="/Faroe_Islands" title="Faroe Islands">Faroese</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-DSTimm"><a href="#_note-DSTimm" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Danes speak the national language, <a href="/Danish_language" title="Danish language">Danish</a>, which is very similar to the other <a href="/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavian</a> languages. Swedish and Norwegian are so close to Danish that most Danes understand them. </p>
<p>As well as Danish, most Danes speak a foreign language too, such as <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a>, which is popular as an <a href="/International" title="International">international</a> language, or <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a>. In the southern part of Jutland, a German minority speaks <a href="/German_language" title="German language">German</a>. On the <a href="/Faroe_Islands" title="Faroe Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, <a href="/Faroese_language" title="Faroese language">Faroese</a> is spoken, and people living in <a href="/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> speak <a href="/Greenlandic_language" title="Greenlandic language">Inuit</a>. </p>
<p>Religion does not play a large part in the life of most Danes and church attendance is very low. However, even though many Danes are <a href="/Atheist" title="Atheist">atheist</a>, 80.4%<sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> are members of the Protestant "Church of Denmark" ({{lang-da|Folkekirke}} (The National Church) which is the official "state church" of Denmark. The National Church is <a href="/Lutheran" title="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, which means it separated from the <a href="/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> in the <a href="/16th_Century" title="16th Century">16th Century</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport">Transport</span></h2>


<p> 
Because of the many islands, Denmark has many <a href="/Bridge" title="Bridge">bridges</a>. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by <a href="/Road" title="Road">roads</a> and <a href="/Railroad" title="Railroad">railroads</a>. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years.  The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers.</p>
<p>There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by <a href="/Boat" title="Boat">boat</a> or <a href="/Airplane" title="Airplane">airplane</a> to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away.  If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build. </p>
<p><a href="/Cycling" title="Cycling">Cycling</a> is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat. <a href="/Copenhagen" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> is a city that is very bicycle friendly, with bicycle lanes extending over 12,000 km.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-14"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
