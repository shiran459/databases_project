<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_health">Physical health</span></h3>
<p>Physical fitness refers to good <a href="/Human_body" title="Human body">body</a> health. It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social, economic and ecological factors. That means, one´s genes are partly responsible for one´s physical health, but also other circumstances: where you live, how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is. It is also the result of regular <a href="/Exercise" title="Exercise">exercise</a>, proper <a href="/Diet" title="Diet">diet</a> and <a href="/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a>, and proper rest for physical <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recovery">recovery</a>. A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help. How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman. A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height. The relation between their height and weight is called their <a href="/Body_Mass_Index" title="Body Mass Index">Body Mass Index</a>. A taller person can be heavier and still be fit. If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mental health refers to a person's <a href="/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotional</a> and <a href="/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychological</a> well-being. "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional (feeling) abilities, <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/function">function</a> in <a href="/Society" title="Society">society</a>, and meet the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ordinary">ordinary</a> demands of everyday life."</p>
<p>One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions. Feeling <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/capable">capable</a> and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/efficient">efficient</a>; being able to handle normal levels of <a href="/Stress_(medicine)" title="Stress (medicine)">stress</a>, have good friends and family, and lead an <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/independent">independent</a> life; and being able to "bounce back," or <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recover">recover</a> from hardships, are all signs of mental health.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Public_health">Public health</span></h3>
<p>{{Main|Public health}}
<a href="/Public_health" title="Public health">Public health</a> refers to trying to stop a <a href="/Disease" title="Disease">disease</a> that is unhealthy to the community, and does not help in long life or promote your health. This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society, public and private clubs, communities and individuals.</p>
<p>It is about the health of many people, or everybody, rather than one person. Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through <a href="/Disease_surveillance" title="Disease surveillance">surveillance</a> of cases. To prevent being sick, it is good to act according to some simple advice:  <a href="/Hand_washing" title="Hand washing">Hand washing</a>, regular check-ups,  <a href="/Vaccination" title="Vaccination">vaccination</a> programmes, clean water and using <a href="/Condom" title="Condom">condoms</a>. When <a href="/Infectious_disease" title="Infectious disease">infectious diseases</a> break out, washing hands for about 30 seconds may be especially important. Sometimes it is necessary to avoid masses of people or wear a surgical mask to protect yourself and to stop the spreading of the disease. Teaching people how to live healthily and educate them, especially about sex and child-birth, is also very important.</p>
