<b>Food</b> is what <a href="/People" title="People">people</a> and animals eat. Food usually comes from <a href="/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a> or <a href="/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a>. It is eaten by living things to provide <a href="/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> and <a href="/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-eb"><a href="#_note-eb" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Food contains the <a href="/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a> that people and animals need to be healthy.

<p>Food for humans is mostly made through <a href="/Farming" title="Farming">farming</a> or <a href="/Gardening" title="Gardening">gardening</a>. It includes animal and vegetable sources.
