<p>In a <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a> whose system of <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a> is a <a href="/Monarchy" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, the ruler, or <a href="/Head_of_state" title="Head of state">head of state</a>, is decided by <a href="/Inheritance" title="Inheritance">inheritance</a>. That is, when a ruler dies their child, or nearest relative, takes over. For much of <a href="/History" title="History">history</a> most countries were governed in this way, especially in Europe. Some countries elect their monarch instead of using inheritance, like the <a href="/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and <a href="/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Wife" title="Wife">wife</a> of a king is also called a queen. However the husband of a female ruler is not called a king. The last King of Britain (<a href="/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI</a>) had a wife (Elizabeth) who was called <a href="/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon" title="Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon">Queen Elizabeth</a>. He had no sons, so he was followed by his elder daughter. She is also called Elizabeth and became <a href="/Queen_Elizabeth_II" title="Queen Elizabeth II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. She is married to <a href="/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh" title="Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh">The Duke of Edinburgh</a>; but when she became Queen he did not become King.</p>
<p>Many people do not think it is good to have a Queen, because she is not elected, though most people in the UK want to keep the royal family.</p>
