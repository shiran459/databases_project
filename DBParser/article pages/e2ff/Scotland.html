<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>


<p>The history of Scotland begins around 12,800 years ago, when <a href="/Human" title="Human">humans</a> first began to live in Scotland after the end of the last <a href="/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice age</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-16"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-17"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Of the <a href="/Stone_Age" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a>, <a href="/Bronze_Age" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a>, and <a href="/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilization</a> that existed in the country, many <a href="/Fossil" title="Fossil">fossils</a> remain, but no written records were left behind. These people did not have <a href="/Writing" title="Writing">writing</a>.</p>
<p>The written history of Scotland begins when the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> came to Britain, and the Romans invaded what is now <a href="/England" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a>, calling it <a href="/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Britannia</a>. To the north was <i>Caledonia</i>, land not owned by the Romans. Its people were the <a href="/Picts" title="Picts">Picts</a>. This meant the Scottish were not affected by the Romans in the same way the English were. The sea was very important for trade reasons.</p>
<p>Because of where Scotland is in the world and its strong <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reliance">reliance</a> on trade routes by sea, the nation held close links in the south and east with the Baltic countries, and through Ireland with France and Europe. Following the <a href="/Acts_of_Union_1707" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union</a> and <a href="/Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, Scotland grew to be one of the largest commercial, intellectual and industrial states in Europe.</p>

<p>
{{main|Wars of Scottish Independence}}
The <a href="/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence" title="Wars of Scottish Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> were many military <a href="/Campaign" title="Campaign">campaigns</a> fought between <b>Scotland</b> and <a href="/England" title="England">England</a> in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.</p>
<p>The First War (1296–1328) began with the <a href="/Kingdom_of_England" title="Kingdom of England">English</a> invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the <a href="/Treaty_of_Edinburgh-Northampton" title="Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton">Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton</a> in 1328. The Second War (1332–1357) began with the <a href="/England" title="England">English</a>-supported invasion of Scotland by <a href="/Edward_Balliol" title="Edward Balliol">Edward Balliol</a> and the 'Disinherited' in 1332, and ended around 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of <a href="/Berwick-upon-Tweed" title="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick</a>.</p>
<p>The wars were part of a great national crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most important moments in the nation's history. At the end of both wars, Scotland still was a free and independent country, which was its main aim throughout the conflict. The wars were also important for other reasons, such as the invention of the <a href="/Longbow" title="Longbow">longbow</a> as an important weapon in <a href="/Medieval_warfare" title="Medieval warfare">medieval warfare</a>.</p>
<p>A series of deaths in the line of succession in the 1280s, followed by King <a href="/Alexander_III_of_Scotland" title="Alexander III of Scotland">Alexander III</a>'s death in 1286 left the Scottish crown in crisis. His granddaughter, <a href="/Margaret_I_of_Scotland" title="Margaret I of Scotland">Margaret, the "Maid of Norway"</a>, a four-year old girl, was the heir.</p>
<p><a href="/Edward_I_of_England" title="Edward I of England">Edward I of England</a>, as Margaret's great-uncle, suggested that his son (also a child) and Margaret should marry, stabilising the Scottish line of succession. In 1290 Margaret's guardians agreed to this, but Margaret herself died in <a href="/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> on her voyage from Norway to Scotland of <a href="/Sea_sickness" title="Sea sickness">sea sickness</a> before she was made Queen, or her wedding could take place.</p>
<p>Because there was no clear heir to the throne anymore, the Scottish people decided to ask Edward I of England to choose their king. The strongest candidate was called <a href="/Robert_Bruce" title="Robert Bruce">Robert Bruce</a>. Robert Bruce had castles all around the country, and had a private army. But Edward wanted to invade Scotland, so he chose the weaker candidate, who was <a href="/John_I_of_Scotland" title="John I of Scotland">John Balliol</a>. He had the strongest claim to the throne, and became king on 30 November 1292. Robert Bruce decided to accept this decision (his grandson and  <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/namesake">namesake</a> later took the throne as Robert I).</p>


<p>
Over the next few years, Edward I kept trying to undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295, John, on the recommendation of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>. This was the beginning of the <a href="/Auld_Alliance" title="Auld Alliance">Auld Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland. He removed King John from power, and put him in jail. The following year <a href="/William_Wallace" title="William Wallace">William Wallace</a> and <a href="/Andrew_de_Moray" title="Andrew de Moray">Andrew de Moray</a> raised an army from the southern and northern parts of the country to fight the English. Under their joint leadership, an English army was defeated at the <a href="/Battle_of_Stirling_Bridge" title="Battle of Stirling Bridge">Battle of Stirling Bridge</a>. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm.</p>
<p>Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the <a href="/Battle_of_Falkirk" title="Battle of Falkirk">Battle of Falkirk</a> in 1298. Wallace escaped but resigned as Guardian of Scotland. <a href="/John_III_Comyn%2C_Lord_of_Badenoch" title="John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch">John Comyn</a> and <a href="/Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="Robert I of Scotland">Robert the Bruce</a> were put in his place. In 1305 Wallace was captured by the English, who executed him for treason. Wallace claimed he did not commit treason as he was not loyal to England.
</p>


<p>In February 1306 Robert Bruce murdered John Comyn, a leading rival, in a <a href="/Church" title="Church">church</a>. Bruce went on to take the crown, but Edward's army overran the country yet again after defeating Bruce's small army at the <a href="/Battle_of_Methven" title="Battle of Methven">Battle of Methven</a>. Despite the <a href="/Excommunication" title="Excommunication">excommunication</a> of Bruce and his followers by <a href="/Pope_Clement_V" title="Pope Clement V">Pope Clement V</a>, his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314, with the help of leading nobles such as <a href="/Sir_James_Douglas" title="Sir James Douglas">Sir James Douglas</a> and the <a href="/Thomas_Randolph%2C_1st_Earl_of_Moray" title="Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray">Earl of Moray</a>, only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling were still under English control.</p>
<p>Edward I died in <a href="/Carlisle" title="Carlisle">Carlisle</a> in 1307. His heir, <a href="/Edward_II_of_England" title="Edward II of England">Edward II</a>, moved an army north to break the siege of <a href="/Stirling_Castle" title="Stirling Castle">Stirling Castle</a> and again take control. Robert defeated that army at the <a href="/Battle_of_Bannockburn" title="Battle of Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a> in 1314, securing temporary independence. In 1320, a letter to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland (the <a href="/Declaration_of_Arbroath" title="Declaration of Arbroath">Declaration of Arbroath</a>) went part of the way towards convincing <a href="/Pope_John_XXII" title="Pope John XXII">Pope John XXII</a> to overturn the earlier excommunication and cancel the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's independence could be recognised by other European countries.</p>
<p>In 1326, the first full <a href="/Parliament_of_Scotland" title="Parliament of Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> met. The parliament was made from an earlier council of nobility and clergy around 1235, but in 1326 representatives of the burghs — the burgh commissioners — joined them to form the Three Estates.</p>
<p>In 1328, <a href="/Edward_III_of_England" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a> signed the <a href="/Treaty_of_Northampton" title="Treaty of Northampton">Treaty of Northampton</a> which declared Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce. Four years after Robert's death in 1329, England invaded Scotland yet again, looking to put the "Rightful King" — <a href="/Edward_Balliol" title="Edward Balliol">Edward Balliol</a>, son of John Balliol — to the Scottish throne, starting the Second War of Independence. In the face of tough Scottish resistance, led by <a href="/Sir_Andrew_Murray" title="Sir Andrew Murray">Sir Andrew Murray</a>, attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed. Edward III lost interest in Balliol after the outbreak of the <a href="/Hundred_Years'_War" title="Hundred Years' War">Hundred Years' War</a> with France.  In 1341 <a href="/David_II_of_Scotland" title="David II of Scotland">David II</a>, King Robert's son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his empty claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364.</p>
