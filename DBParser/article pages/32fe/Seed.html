A <b>seed</b> is the part of a <a href="/Seed_plant" title="Seed plant">seed plant</a> which can grow into a new plant. It is a <a href="/Reproduction" title="Reproduction">reproductive</a> structure which disperses,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and can survive for some time. A typical seed includes three basic parts: (1) an <a href="/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryo</a>, (2) a supply of <a href="/Nutrient" title="Nutrient">nutrients</a> for the embryo, and (3) a seed coat.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of seeds. Some plants make a lot of seeds, some make only a few. Seeds are often hard and very small, but some are larger. The <a href="/Coconut" title="Coconut">coconut</a> is as big as a <a href="/Child" title="Child">child</a>'s <a href="/Head" title="Head">head</a>, but it contains more than just a seed. At the start, seeds are <i>dormant</i> (resting inside their coat) for a while. When the seed is ready to develop, it needs water, air and warmth <i>but not sunlight</i> to become a <a href="/Seedling" title="Seedling">seedling</a>.</p>
<p>Seeds carry the <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a> that helps the new plant begin to grow. This food store is in the <a href="/Endosperm" title="Endosperm">endosperm</a>, and/or in the <a href="/Cotyledon" title="Cotyledon">cotyledons</a>. Many kinds of seeds are good food for <a href="/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a> and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/people">people</a>. The many kinds of <a href="/Grain" title="Grain">grain</a> that people grow, such as <a href="/Rice" title="Rice">rice</a>, <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, and <a href="/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a>, are all seeds. Seeds are often inside <a href="/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>.</p>

<p>A seed, though not active, is a tiny living thing. It contains the embryo of the future plant, which is not changing or developing: it is <i>dormant</i>. The common idea is that the seed "sleeps" until it gets what it needs to wake up. That is not correct. Different seeds have different habits, no doubt adapted to their <a href="/Habitat" title="Habitat">habitat</a>. There are different kinds of resting stages in seeds:<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Baskin.2C_C.C_1998"><a href="#_note-Baskin.2C_C.C_1998" title="">[2]</a></sup>

<dd>1. Seed <b>dormancy</b>: means the seed does not develop for a while <i>even when conditions are suitable</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Fenner"><a href="#_note-Fenner" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup>p98</sup> Delayed <a href="/Germination" title="Germination">germination</a> (development) allows time for dispersal. Changes take place inside the seed which sooner or later make it germinate. The details vary hugely between <a href="/Species" title="Species">species</a>.</dd>
<dd>2. Seed <b>hibernation</b>: fails to germinate because conditions are not right. Growth is <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trigger">triggered</a> by particular events in the <a href="/Environment" title="Environment">environment</a>. Details of the triggers are known for some, but not all, seeds. <a href="/Rain" title="Rain">Rain</a>, <a href="/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a>, ground <a href="/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a>, are examples. Many seeds only germinate after they have been <a href="/Eaten" title="Eaten">eaten</a> and passed through the <a href="/Digestive_system" title="Digestive system">digestive system</a> of an animal. This also is a dispersal method.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When a seed germinates ("wakes up"), it begins to grow into a little plant called a <i>seedling</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Baskin.2C_C.C_1998_b"><a href="#_note-Baskin.2C_C.C_1998" title="">[2]</a></sup> It uses the soft fleshy <a href="/Material" title="Material">material</a> inside the seed for nutrients (food) until it is ready to make food on its own using sunlight, water and air.</p>
<p>Most seeds germinate underground where there is no sunlight. The plant does not need the nutrients in soil for a few days or weeks, because the seed has all the things it needs to grow.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Fenner_b"><a href="#_note-Fenner" title="">[3]</a></sup> Later, though, it will begin to need sunlight. If there is sunlight, the plant will use it to grow healthy. If there is no light, the plant will still grow for a while, but its <a href="/Plastid" title="Plastid">plastids</a> will not mature: the chlorophyll does not turn green. If the plant does not get enough light, it will eventually die. It needs light to make food for itself when the reserve in the seed runs out.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Baskin.2C_C.C_1998_c"><a href="#_note-Baskin.2C_C.C_1998" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>The oldest <a href="/Radiocarbon_dating" title="Radiocarbon dating">carbon 14</a>-dated seed that has grown into a plant was a Judean <a href="/Date_palm" title="Date palm">date palm</a> seed about 2,000 years old, recovered from excavations at <a href="/Agrippa_I" title="Agrippa I">Herod the Great</a>'s palace on <a href="/Masada" title="Masada">Masada</a> in <a href="/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>. It was germinated in 2005.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The largest seed is produced by the <i>Coco de mer</i>, or "double coconut palm", <i>Lodoicea maldivica</i>.  The entire fruit may weigh up to 23 kilograms (50 pounds) and usually contains a single seed.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_and_evolution">Origin and evolution</span></h2>
<p>Seeds have been an important development in the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reproduction">reproduction</a> and spread of <a href="/Conifer" title="Conifer">conifers</a> and <a href="/Flowering_plants" title="Flowering plants">flowering plants</a>. Plants such as <a href="/Moss" title="Moss">mosses</a>, <a href="/Liverwort" title="Liverwort">liverworts</a> and <a href="/Fern" title="Fern">ferns</a> do not have seeds, and use unprotected <a href="/Spore" title="Spore">spores</a> and other methods to <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/propagation">propagate</a> themselves. Before the upper <a href="/Devonian" title="Devonian">Devonian</a> period, land plants, like modern ferns, reproduced by sending spores into the air. The spores would land and become new plants only in favourable conditions. Spores have little food stored, and may be just single cells rather than embryos. </p>
<p>The evolution of seeds changed the plant <a href="/Life_cycle" title="Life cycle">life cycle</a> by freeing plants from the need for external water for <a href="/Sexual_reproduction" title="Sexual reproduction">sexual reproduction</a>, and by providing protection and nutrients for the developing embryo. These functions allowed plants to expand beyond the immediate neighbourhood of water sources. They were able to exploit environments which were drier and more upland.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Willis"><a href="#_note-Willis" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup>p92</sup> This can be seen by the success of seed plants in important biological <a href="/Ecological_niche" title="Ecological niche">niches</a> on land, from <a href="/Forest" title="Forest">forests</a> to <a href="/Grassland" title="Grassland">grasslands</a> both in hot and cold <a href="/Climate" title="Climate">climates</a>. The present-day seed plants are the <a href="/Gymnosperm" title="Gymnosperm">Gymnosperms</a>, with naked seeds, and the <a href="/Angiosperm" title="Angiosperm">Angiosperms</a> with covered seeds, usually fruits.</p>
<p>The first true seeds are from the upper Devonian 370â€“354 million years ago, which is probably the theatre of their first <a href="/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> radiation. The earliest seed-producing <a href="/Tree" title="Tree">trees</a> were in the forests of the <a href="/Carboniferous" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> period.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Willis_b"><a href="#_note-Willis" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup>p112</sup> The seed plants steadily became one of the most important elements of nearly all <a href="/Ecosystem" title="Ecosystem">ecosystems</a>.</p>
