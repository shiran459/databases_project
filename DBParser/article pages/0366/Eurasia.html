<b>Eurasia</b> is the combined landmass of the continents of Europe and Asia in the <a href="/North" title="North">northern</a> part of the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. Eurasia is made of <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, which are on the same <a href="/Tectonic_plate" title="Tectonic plate">tectonic plate</a> and do not have a <a href="/Sea" title="Sea">sea</a> between them.  The word is made by adding "Eur" (from <i>Eur</i>ope) to "Asia" to make "Eurasia".</p>
<p>Some <a href="/Geography" title="Geography">geographers</a> say it's all just one continent, because unlike <a href="/The_Americas" title="The Americas">the Americas</a> or <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, Europe and Asia are not divided by <a href="/Sea" title="Sea">sea</a>.  The <a href="/Ancient_Greeks" title="Ancient Greeks">Ancient Greeks</a> <a href="/Division" title="Division">divided</a> the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa.   Since then, people have been talking about Asia and Europe as two continents so it is now a <a href="/Tradition" title="Tradition">tradition</a>.      </p>
<p>Some other continents are not completely divided by sea and are joined together and by a thin strip of land (called an <a href="/Isthmus" title="Isthmus">isthmus</a>) like <a href="/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>.  However, Europe and Asia are not divided by sea at all.</p>
<p>Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. West Eurasia is Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia because the <a href="/Sahara_Desert" title="Sahara Desert">Sahara Desert</a> divides North Africa from the other parts of Africa and it is as difficult to cross as a sea.</p>
