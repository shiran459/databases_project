<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Ipswich Town F.C. was started as an <a href="/Amateur" title="Amateur">amateur</a> team in 1878 and was called "Ipswich A.F.C."<sup class="reference" id="_ref-cobbolds"><a href="#_note-cobbolds" title="">[2]</a></sup> The club played a lot of games in the local area and won several <a href="/Trophy" title="Trophy">cup</a> <a href="/Competition" title="Competition">competitions</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1936, they became a <a href="/Professional" title="Professional">professional</a> club and joined a league called the "Southern League" which they won in their first <a href="/Season" title="Season">season</a>.  In 1938, they were <a href="/Election" title="Election">elected</a> to join <a href="/The_Football_League" title="The Football League">The Football League</a> and played in "Division Three (South)" until the end of the 1954 season, when they were <a href="/Promotion" title="Promotion">promoted</a> to "Division Two".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-History"><a href="#_note-History" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1961, Ipswich Town won their division and were promoted to the highest level of <a href="/England" title="England">English</a> football, "<a href="/English_Premier_League" title="English Premier League">Division One</a>".  The club went on to win this division the next season.  This earned them the right to play in a <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> football competition, <a href="/UEFA_Champions_League" title="UEFA Champions League">The European Cup</a> the following season.  Two years later,they were sent back to "Division Two" where they stayed for four years before being promoted to "Division One" again, in 1968.  Soon after, <a href="/Bobby_Robson" title="Bobby Robson">Bobby Robson</a> became the <a href="/Coach_(sport)" title="Coach (sport)">manager</a> of the club and led them to success in both English and European football.  In 1978 Ipswich won the <a href="/FA_Cup" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> at <a href="/Wembley_Stadium" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, beating <a href="/Arsenal_F.C." title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a> 1–0.  Further success came in 1981 when Ipswich defeated <a href="/Holland" title="Holland">Dutch</a> team <a href="/AZ_Alkmaar" title="AZ Alkmaar">AZ Alkmaar</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bobby Robson was asked to become manager of the <a href="/England_national_football_team" title="England national football team">England national football team</a> in 1982 so he left the club.  Ipswich did not do well in the following seasons and were relegated to "Division Two" in 1986.  They remained here until 1993 when they won the division and promotion into the new <a href="/English_Premier_League" title="English Premier League">English Premier League</a>.  Two poor seasons followed, including a 9–0 defeat by <a href="/Manchester_United_F.C." title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a>, still the biggest defeat in Premier League history.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  In 1995 Ipswich were relegated once again and stayed in second division of English football until they were promoted in 2000 after they beat <a href="/Barnsley_F.C." title="Barnsley F.C.">Barnsley</a> in the <a href="/Football_League_play-offs" title="Football League play-offs">play-offs</a> at Wembley 4–2.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-History_b"><a href="#_note-History" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In their first season in the Premier League, Ipswich finished fifth.  This meant they qualified to play in the UEFA Cup the next season.  Although the club played well in the European competition, they were poor in the Premier League.  They finished bottom and were relegated to Division One, now called <a href="/Football_League_Championship" title="Football League Championship">Football League Championship</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-History_c"><a href="#_note-History" title="">[4]</a></sup>  As of the end of the 2011 season, the club are still in this division.</p>
