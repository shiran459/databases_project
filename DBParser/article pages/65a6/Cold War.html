<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>The start of the Cold War in 1947 was due to a belief that all governments would become either <a href="/Communism" title="Communism">communist</a> or <a href="/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a>. The Western allies feared that the Soviet Union would use force to expand its influence in Europe,  and was especially concerned that Soviet agents had obtained information on making the <a href="/Atom_Bomb" title="Atom Bomb">Atom Bomb</a> after the war.</p>
<p>Both groups of nations had opposed <a href="/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.  The <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> had initially co-operated with Germany in the division of <a href="/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a> in 1939, but turned against Germany in June 1941.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="After_World_War_II">After World War II</span></h2>


<p>After WWII, Germany was left in ruins. The victorious Allies that <a href="/Occupied_territory" title="Occupied territory">occupied it</a> split it into four parts. One part was given to the United Kingdom, one part to France, one part to the United States, and the eastern part was occupied by the USSR.  The city of <a href="/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> was also partitioned among the four parties even though the USSR had conquered it.</p>


<p>The <a href="/Federal_Republic_of_Germany" title="Federal Republic of Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a> (<i>Bundesrepublik Deutschland</i> or BRD) was recognized by the Western allies in June 1949.  From April 1948 to May 1949, the Soviets blockaded West Berlin,  which led to the <a href="/Berlin_Airlift" title="Berlin Airlift">Berlin Airlift</a>.    The USSR named their section of Germany the <a href="/German_Democratic_Republic" title="German Democratic Republic">German Democratic Republic</a> (<i>Deutsche Demokratische Republik</i> or DDR) later in 1949.</p>
<p>The western parts of Berlin were called <a href="/West_Berlin" title="West Berlin">West Berlin</a>, inside the DDR. The <a href="/Berlin_wall" title="Berlin wall">Berlin wall</a> built in 1961 divided the two parts of Berlin and was part of the <a href="/Iron_curtain" title="Iron curtain">iron curtain</a> that divided Europe.</p>

<p><a href="/Espionage" title="Espionage">Espionage</a>, "spying"  has been around for a very long time, and was very important during the Cold War. After its successful <a href="/Nuclear_espionage" title="Nuclear espionage">nuclear espionage</a> in the <a href="/Manhattan_Project" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a> the USSR built up its spy organs, especially the <a href="/KGB" title="KGB">KGB</a>. The <a href="/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> led US efforts abroad, while the <a href="/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a> did counterespionage. Catching foreign spies was among KGB functions, as well as fighting domestic <a href="/Subversion" title="Subversion">subversion</a>.</p>
<p>In the USSR, the dictator <a href="/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> died and <a href="/Nikolai_Bulganin" title="Nikolai Bulganin">Nikolai Bulganin</a> and <a href="/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> (1953) took his place.  Khrushchev later took sole control of the USSR.  <a href="/Khrushchev's_Secret_Speech" title="Khrushchev's Secret Speech">Khrushchev's Secret Speech</a> marked a period of <a href="/De-Stalinization" title="De-Stalinization">de-Stalinization</a> and Khrushchev tried to undo many of the things Stalin did (such as the <a href="/Gulag" title="Gulag">Gulag</a> prison camps and cult of personality).</p>
<p>In the United States, there was a "Red Scare", and when the USSR detonated its own atom bomb, there was a great deal of political <a href="/Fallout" title="Fallout">fallout</a>.  Noted persons in many fields who had been Communist sympathizers in the past lost their positions.  Many actors were 'blacklisted' and were not hired to act in movies, ruining their careers. Senator <a href="/Joseph_McCarthy" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> accused some important Americans of being communists, including some high government officials.</p>




<p>The 1950s were the beginning of the <a href="/Space_race" title="Space race">space race</a> between the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/USSR" title="USSR">USSR</a>. It began with the USSR putting the <a href="/Sputnik" title="Sputnik">Sputnik</a> satellite into orbit around <a href="/The_Earth" title="The Earth">the Earth</a>, making the Soviet Union the first country in space. The United States responded by starting <a href="/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>, and soon sent up its own satellites. The Soviet Union also sent the first man (<a href="/Yuri_Gagarin" title="Yuri Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>) into Earth orbit, claiming that this proved communism was the better ideology.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, the United States (under president <a href="/Dwight_Eisenhower" title="Dwight Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>) created a policy called "New Look," cutting defense spending and increasing the number of nuclear weapons as a deterrent in order to prevent the Soviet Union from attacking the USA.  The USSR also increased their nuclear force, resulting in  <a href="/Mutual_assured_destruction" title="Mutual assured destruction">mutual assured destruction</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/Suez_Canal" title="Suez Canal">Suez</a> Crisis of 1956, the Cold War alliances were broken for the first time with the Soviet Union and United States favouring one side, and Britain and France the other. Later that year, the Western allies did not interfere when Soviet troops suppressed an anti-communist revolution in <a href="/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>.</p>
<p>United States Vice-President <a href="/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> engaged in several talks with Nikita Khrushchev during the <a href="/1950s" title="1950s">1950s</a>. One of these was the 1959 "<a href="/Kitchen_Debate" title="Kitchen Debate">Kitchen Debate</a>" in a model kitchen in <a href="/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. These debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the USA and the USSR. The following year, the United States <a href="/Lockheed_U-2" title="Lockheed U-2">U-2 spy plane</a> crashed in the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Tensions between the two countries increased.</p>

<p>{{main article|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
</p>


<p>
</p>


<p>After the United States tried to invade <a href="/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> and failed (<a href="/Bay_of_Pigs" title="Bay of Pigs">Bay of Pigs</a>), the Soviet Union attempted to supply Cuba with <a href="/Nuclear_missiles" title="Nuclear missiles">nuclear missiles</a>. These missiles in Cuba would have allowed the Soviet Union to effectively target almost the entire United States. In response the United States sent a large number of ships to blockade Cuba thus preventing the Soviet Union from delivering these weapons. The United States and Soviet Union came to agreement that the Soviet Union would no longer give nuclear weapons to Cuba as long as the United States does not invade Cuba again. This was the highest period of tension during the Cold War and it was the closest the world came to a nuclear war, with possible global conflict to follow. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="D.C3.A9tente_.281962.E2.80.931981.29">Détente (1962–1981)</span></h2>
<p>After the agreement that ended the Cuban Missile Crisis, relations between the two sides eased. Several treaties, designed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, were signed. During this period, the United States began building a good relationship with China, a previous ally of  Russia.</p>

<p>The policy of détente ended in 1981, when the U.S. president <a href="/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> ordered a massive military build-up to challenge the Soviet Union's influence around the world. The United States began to support anti-communists all over the world with money and weapons. The idea was to help them overthrow their communist governments.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had a slow economy during this decade because military spending was at an all-time high. They tried to keep up with the United States in military spending, but could not. In the <a href="/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan" title="Soviet war in Afghanistan">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a> starting in 1979, the Soviet Union had a difficult time fighting resistance groups, some of them armed and trained by the United States. The Soviet Union's failed invasion of <a href="/Afghanistan" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> is often compared to the United States' failure during the Vietnam War.
</p>


<p>In the late 1980s the new Soviet President <a href="/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> made an effort to make an ally of the United States to fix world problems caused by the war, with the ultimate aim of eliminating <a href="/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> completely. However, this did not take place because the President of the United States, <a href="/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, insisted on having a nuclear missile defense system. The people of the Soviet Union were divided on their feelings about this. Some wanted President Gorbachev to fight harder to eliminate nuclear weapons, while others did not want him to be talking to the United States at all. These mixed feelings created an atmosphere of political in-fighting, and the people were no longer united behind one goal. Because of this, leaders of the Soviet Union started to fight against each other, the Communist Party began to crumble and the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
<p>After the fall of the <a href="/Berlin_Wall" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> in 1989 and without Communist rule holding together the countries that comprised the Soviet Union, the USSR broke into smaller countries, like <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and <a href="/Georgia_(country)" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>. The nations of <a href="/Eastern_Europe" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> returned to capitalism, and the period of the Cold War was over. The Soviet Union ended in December 1991.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Not all historians agree on when the Cold War ended. Some think it ended when the Berlin Wall fell. Others think it ended when the Soviet Union collapsed  in 1991.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
