<p><b>Arithmetic</b> is a name for working with <a href="/Number" title="Number">numbers</a>. It is a part of <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>. The four basic arithmetic operations are <a href="/Addition" title="Addition">addition</a>, <a href="/Subtraction" title="Subtraction">subtraction</a>, <a href="/Multiplication" title="Multiplication">multiplication</a>, and <a href="/Division_(mathematics)" title="Division (mathematics)">division</a>.</p>
<p>Harder arithmetic includes working with <a href="/Signed_number" title="Signed number">signed numbers</a>, <a href="/Fraction_(mathematics)" title="Fraction (mathematics)">fractions</a>, and <a href="/Decimal" title="Decimal">decimals</a>, and taking <a href="/Power_(math)" title="Power (math)">powers</a> and <a href="/Root_(math)" title="Root (math)">roots</a>.</p>
<p>Most people learn arithmetic in <a href="/Primary_school" title="Primary school">primary school</a>, but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include <a href="/Carpenter" title="Carpenter">carpenters</a>, <a href="/Plumber" title="Plumber">plumbers</a>, <a href="/Automobile_mechanic" title="Automobile mechanic">auto mechanics</a>, <a href="/Accountant" title="Accountant">accountants</a>, <a href="/Architect" title="Architect">architects</a>, <a href="/Medical_doctor" title="Medical doctor">doctors</a>, and <a href="/Nurse" title="Nurse">nurses</a>. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a>, and <a href="/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a>. </p>
<p>A <a href="/Calculator" title="Calculator">calculator</a> can be used to do arithmetic. <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">Computers</a> can do it more quickly, which is one reason <a href="/Global_Positioning_System" title="Global Positioning System">Global Positioning System</a> receivers have a small computer inside. </p>

<ul>
<li>2 + 3 = 5 (adding is <a href="/Commutative_property" title="Commutative property">commutative</a>: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)</li>
</ul>
