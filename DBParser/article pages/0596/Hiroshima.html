At the time of the attack, Hiroshima was the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and 5th Division, containing 40,000 Japanese soldiers within the city's limit, and was a beehive of war industry, which manufactured parts for planes and boats, bombs, rifles, and handguns, where children were shown how to construct and hurl gasoline bombs and the wheelchair-bound and bedridden were assembling booby traps to be planted in the beaches of Kyushu.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> As with other Japanese cities, many of the strategic targets in Hiroshima were mixed with wooden and paper civilian homes and centers, which made it harder to conduct a successful precision attack, owing to the highly inaccuracy of the bombing technology in <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. As a result, the city became the first <a href="/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapon</a> used against a target in history.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-bbc"><a href="#_note-bbc" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The bomb exploded over Hiroshima at 8:16 on the morning of <a href="/August_6" title="August 6">August 6</a>, <a href="/1945" title="1945">1945</a>. Much of the city was destroyed. An estimated 70,000 persons, of whom 20,000 were Japanese soldiers and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers, were killed, and another 70,000 were injured.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The bomb was <a href="/Nickname" title="Nickname">nicknamed</a> <i>Little Boy</i> after President <a href="/Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-bbc_b"><a href="#_note-bbc" title="">[3]</a></sup> A building near the blast center still remains and is called the Atomic Bomb Dome.</p>
