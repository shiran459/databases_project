<p><b>Northern Ireland</b> ({{lang-ga|Tuaisceart Éireann}}, Ulster {{lang-sco|Norlin Airlann}}) is a province of <a href="/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. </p>
<p>The whole island of Ireland used to be a <a href="/Kingdom" title="Kingdom">kingdom</a>, called the <a href="/Kingdom_of_Ireland" title="Kingdom of Ireland">Kingdom of Ireland</a>. But after the <a href="/Act_of_Union_1800" title="Act of Union 1800">Act of Union</a> in the year 1800, it became part of the <a href="/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>. This stayed until 1922, after a <a href="/Irish_War_of_Independence" title="Irish War of Independence">civil war</a>, when Ireland was divided into the <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, the <a href="/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">sovereign state</a> that takes up the southern part of the island, and Northern Ireland, which chose to stay as part of the UK.</p>
<p>About 1.8 million people live in Northern Ireland, and the <a href="/Capital_city" title="Capital city">capital</a> and largest city is <a href="/Belfast" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes people use other names for Northern Ireland. Some call it <a href="/Ulster" title="Ulster">Ulster</a>, even though some parts of Ulster are actually in the Republic of Ireland. Others call it "the North" or "the Six Counties", because they do not want to recognise that a part of the island of Ireland is not <a href="/Independence" title="Independence">independent</a> and is actually in the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland is the smallest part of the United Kingdom at 5,345 sq mi.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Languages">Languages</span></h2>
<p><a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> is spoken by almost everyone in Northern Ireland. Another important <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a> is <a href="/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a> (sometimes called "Irish Gaelic") and a language known as <a href="/Ulster_Scots" title="Ulster Scots">Ulster Scots</a>, which comes from Eastern Ulster and Lowland Scotland. The Irish language became less widely spoken in the 20th century, but a revival has led to increased usage, especially in Belfast, the Glens of Antrim and counties Tyrone and Fermanagh. This revival has been driven largely through the creation of Irish-language schools. The Irish language is spoken by some nationalists (whether Catholic or Protestant) people. Ulster Scots is almost exclusive to areas of North Antrim and the Ards Peninsula.</p>
<p>Some languages like <a href="/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, <a href="/Urdu" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> or <a href="/Polish_language" title="Polish language">Polish</a> are becoming more common in Northern Ireland as people from other countries move to Northern Ireland.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Belfast_Agreement">Belfast Agreement</span></h2>
<p>Since the <a href="/Belfast_Agreement" title="Belfast Agreement">Belfast Agreement</a> (sometimes called the Good Friday Agreement) of Friday, 10 April <a href="/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, there has been mainly peace between the two sides of the community. This agreement was agreed by most of the people in Northern Ireland and the <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, as well as the Irish and British governments. It allows for the self-government of Northern Ireland and greater North-South co-operation and co-operation between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, it makes clear the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their constitutional future and select whether they are British citizens, Irish citizens or both.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sport">Sport</span></h2>
<p>The most popular sports in Northern Ireland are <a href="/Association_football" title="Association football">association football</a>, <a href="/Gaelic_football" title="Gaelic football">gaelic football</a> and <a href="/Rugby_union" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>. <a href="/Track_and_field_athletics" title="Track and field athletics">Athletics</a>, <a href="/Boxing" title="Boxing">boxing</a>, <a href="/Cricket" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="/Golf" title="Golf">golf</a>, <a href="/Hockey" title="Hockey">hockey</a>, <a href="/Hurling" title="Hurling">hurling</a>, <a href="/Snooker" title="Snooker">snooker</a> and <a href="/Motor_sports" title="Motor sports">motor sports</a> are also common. Most sports are organised on an all-Ireland basis, and in international competitions, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland compete together as Ireland (e.g. Ireland national rugby union team, Ireland national cricket team). The main exception is football.</p>
<p>Football in Northern Ireland is governed by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In international competitions Northern Ireland has its own team - the <a href="/Northern_Ireland_national_football_team" title="Northern Ireland national football team">Northern Ireland national football team</a>. The Northern Ireland team has qualified for three <a href="/FIFA_World_Cup" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cups</a> (in <a href="/1958_FIFA_World_Cup" title="1958 FIFA World Cup">1958</a>, <a href="/1982_FIFA_World_Cup" title="1982 FIFA World Cup">1982</a> and <a href="/1986_FIFA_World_Cup" title="1986 FIFA World Cup">1986</a>). Perhaps the most famous player from Northern Ireland was <a href="/George_Best" title="George Best">George Best</a>.</p>
<p>Track and field athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to compete either with athletes from Great Britain (as the team "Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland"), or with athletes from the rest of Ireland (as "Ireland").</p>
<p>Belfast is home to the Ulster Rugby team (which competes in the Pro 12 league and <a href="/Heineken_Cup" title="Heineken Cup">Heineken Cup</a>), and the Belfast Giants <a href="/Ice-hockey" title="Ice-hockey">ice-hockey</a> team.</p>
