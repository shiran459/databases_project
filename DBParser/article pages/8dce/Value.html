<p><b>Value</b> is how much something is <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/worth">worth</a>. Often the best way to find the value of something is to use the <a href="/Price" title="Price">price</a> that it can be <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sell">sold</a> for. However <a href="/Oscar_Wilde" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> wrote that 'people know the price of everything but the value of nothing'- in other words true value does not depend on money alone.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Math" title="Math">math</a>, a value is a number which is concrete, something everyone can agree upon.  However people may disagree on the value of water, depending if you live in a desert or next to a river.  Disagreements on the value of things can create fights between nations, political parties, religions, etc.</p>
