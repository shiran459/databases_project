<p>A <b>sin</b> is a bad act. Particularly, it is a bad act against another person(s), an animal, a spirit, or a god. </p>
<p>In <a href="/Abrahamic_religions" title="Abrahamic religions">Abrahamic religions</a>, such as <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, it is an act that goes against what <a href="/God" title="God">God</a> wants. It turns people away from God and true happiness. In <a href="/Exodus" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> chapter 20, <a href="/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a> was given the <a href="/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> by God, explaining important sins like <a href="/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a> and <a href="/Idol" title="Idol">idolatry</a>. This is not believed by all people, and not all societies have the same idea of sin.</p>
<p>There is a difference between sins and prohibitions. For example, <a href="/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> and Jews say that it is wrong to eat <a href="/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a>, and <a href="/Hindu" title="Hindu">Hindus</a> do not eat <a href="/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a>. That is for them, but for others it is not wrong to eat these things. </p>
