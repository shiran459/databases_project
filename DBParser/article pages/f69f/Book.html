<p>A <b>book</b> is a set of <a href="/Printing" title="Printing">printed</a> sheets of <a href="/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a> held together between two covers. The sheets of paper are usually covered with a <a href="/Text" title="Text">text</a>, <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a> and <a href="/Illustration" title="Illustration">illustrations</a> that is the main point of a printed book.</p>
<p>A writer of a book is called an <a href="/Author" title="Author">author</a>. Someone who draws pictures in a book is called an <a href="/Illustrator" title="Illustrator">illustrator</a>. Books can have more than one author or illustrator. </p>
<p>A book can also be a <a href="/Text" title="Text">text</a> in a larger collection of texts. That way a <i>book</i> is perhaps written by one <a href="/Author" title="Author">author</a>, or it only treats one subject area. Books in this sense can often be understood without knowing the whole collection. Examples are the <a href="/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>, the <a href="/Illiad" title="Illiad">Illiad</a> or the <a href="/Odyssey" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> â€“ all of them consist of a number of <i>books</i> in this sense of the word. <a href="/Encyclopedia" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedias</a> often have separate articles written by different people, and published as separate <a href="/Volume" title="Volume">volumes</a>. Each volume is a book.</p>
<p><i>Hardcover</i> books have hard covers made of <a href="/Cardboard" title="Cardboard">cardboard</a> covered in cloth or <a href="/Leather" title="Leather">leather</a> and are usually <a href="/Sewing" title="Sewing">sewn</a> together. <i>Paperback</i> books have covers of stiff paper and are usually <a href="/Glue" title="Glue">glued</a> together. The words in books can be read aloud and recorded on tapes or <a href="/Compact_disc" title="Compact disc">compact discs</a>. These are called "audiobooks".</p>
<p>Books can be borrowed from a <a href="/Library" title="Library">library</a> or bought from a <a href="/Bookstore" title="Bookstore">bookstore</a>. People can make their own books and fill them with family photos, drawings, or their own writing. Some books are empty inside, like a <a href="/Diary" title="Diary">diary</a>, address book, or <a href="/Photo" title="Photo">photo</a> album. Most of the time, the word "book" means that the pages inside have words printed or written on them.</p>
<p>Some books are written just for <a href="/Children" title="Children">children</a>, or for <a href="/Entertainment" title="Entertainment">entertainment</a>, while other books are for studying something in school such as <a href="/Math" title="Math">math</a> or <a href="/History" title="History">history</a>. Many books have photographs or drawings. </p>
<p>People who cannot <a href="/Reading" title="Reading">read</a> books, or any type of writing are called <a href="/Illiterate" title="Illiterate">illiterate</a> (= 'unlettered').</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Types_of_books">Types of books</span></h2>
<p>There are two main kinds of book text: <a href="/Fiction" title="Fiction">fiction</a> and <a href="/Non-fiction" title="Non-fiction">non-fiction</a>. </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fiction">Fiction</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Fiction}}
These books are <a href="/Novels" title="Novels">novels</a>, about stories that did not happen, and have been imagined by the <a href="/Author" title="Author">author</a>. Some books are based on real events from history, but the author has created imaginary characters or <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dialogue">dialogue</a> for the events.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Non-fiction">Non-fiction</span></h3>
<p>{{main|Non-fiction}}
Books of non-fiction are about true <a href="/Fact" title="Fact">facts</a> or things that  have really happened. Some examples are <a href="/Dictionary" title="Dictionary">dictionaries</a>, <a href="/Cookbook" title="Cookbook">cookbooks</a>, <a href="/Textbook" title="Textbook">textbooks</a> for learning in school, or a <a href="/Biography" title="Biography">biography</a> (someone's life story).</p>

<p>
Between the written manuscript and the book lie several inventions. A book is an industrial product, but manuscripts are hand-made.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Manuscripts">Manuscripts</span></h3>
<p>A common type of manuscript was the scroll, which was a long sheet rolled up. The sheet could have been made of <a href="/Papyrus" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a> (made by the <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptians</a>, by <a href="/Weaving" title="Weaving">weaving</a> the inner stems of the papyrus plant and then <a href="/Hammer" title="Hammer">hammering</a> them together), or <a href="/Parchment" title="Parchment">parchment</a> or <a href="/Vellum" title="Vellum">vellum</a> (very thin animal skin, first used by the ancient <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a>), or paper (made from plant <a href="/Fibers" title="Fibers">fibers</a>, invented by the <a href="/China" title="China">Chinese</a>). Turning the manuscript into a book required several developments.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_codex">The codex</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> were the first people to put separate pieces of manuscript between covers, to form a <i>codex</i>. This was more convenient to handle and store than scrolls, but was not yet a book as we understand it.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Printing">Printing</span></h3>
<p>Scrolls and codices were written and copied by hand. The Chinese invented <i>woodblock printing</i>, where shapes are carved out of a block of wood, then <a href="/Ink" title="Ink">ink</a> is applied to the carved side, and the block is pressed onto the paper. This way of making books was very slow, and so very few people had these kinds of books.</p>
<p><a href="/Johannes_Gutenberg" title="Johannes Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a> was the first to invent a machine for printing, the <a href="/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</a>, in the 15th century. This involved more than just a press, it involved the production of movable metal type suitable for the machine process.</p>
<p>Initially, the machines were slow, and needed a printer to work with them. Fast and automatic machines did not arrive until the 19th century.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Paper_and_ink">Paper and ink</span></h3>
<p>Paper had been invented in the 8th century, but hand-made paper was expensive and in short supply. In the 19th century, automated or semi-automated making of paper from wood pulp was invented. Also, there was the invention of <a href="/Ink" title="Ink">inks</a> for various purposes, and machines driven by <a href="/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a>.</p>
<p>The common cheap supply of paper fed the faster printing machines, and books became cheaper. Only then could ordinary people afford to buy books. Along with these inventions in the 19th century came the idea of public libraries, so poorer people could get access to the best books. Also, widespread free (or nearly free) education swelled the number of literate people.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Binding">Binding</span></h3>
<p>Printing was done on large sheets of paper, which were then folded, <a href="/Guillotine" title="Guillotine">guillotined</a> (cut) and <a href="/Sewing" title="Sewing">sewn</a> in sections, and finally placed into the covers. All these processes became done by machines during the 19th century.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Today">Today</span></h3>
<p>Today some of the technologies have been changed, especially those involving <a href="/Illustration" title="Illustration">illustration</a> and <a href="/Typography" title="Typography">typography</a>. However, books look much the same as they did, with more illustration in colour, but basically the same. That is because experience has shown that readers need certain things for pleasurable reading. <a href="/Graphic_design" title="Graphic design">Graphic design</a> and <a href="/Typography" title="Typography">typography</a> are the practical arts used to make books attractive and useful to readers.</p>
