<ul>
<li>An object was moving <a href="/North" title="North">north</a> at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 <a href="/Meter" title="Meter">meters</a> per <a href="/Second" title="Second">second</a>. The object has accelerated. </li>
<li>An <a href="/Apple" title="Apple">apple</a> is falling down. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.</li>
<li>Jane is walking <a href="/East" title="East">east</a> at 3 <a href="/Kilometer" title="Kilometer">kilometers</a> per <a href="/Hour" title="Hour">hour</a>. Jane's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is <a href="/Zero" title="Zero">zero</a>. </li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Finding_acceleration">Finding acceleration</span></h2>

<p>Acceleration is the <a href="/Rate_(mathematics)" title="Rate (mathematics)">rate</a> of change of the <a href="/Velocity" title="Velocity">velocity</a> of an object. Acceleration <span class="math">\mathbf{{a}}</span> can be found by using:<br/>
</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="math">
\mathbf{{a}} = {\mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0} \over { t_1 - t_0 }}</span></dd>
</dl>

<p>where
</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="math">\mathbf{v_0}</span> is the velocity at the start</dd>
<dd><span class="math">\mathbf{v_1}</span> is the velocity at the end</dd>
<dd><span class="math">t_0</span> is the time at the start </dd>
<dd><span class="math">t_1</span> is the time at the end </dd>
</dl>

<p>Sometimes the change in velocity <span class="math"> \mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0}</span> is written as Δ<span class="math">\mathbf{v}</span>. Sometimes the change in time <span class="math">{ t_1 - t_0 }</span> is written as Δt.</p>
<p>In difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>: in <a href="/Calculus" title="Calculus">calculus</a>, acceleration is the <a href="/Derivative_(mathematics)" title="Derivative (mathematics)">derivative</a> of the velocity (with respect to time), <span class="math">\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Units_of_measurement">Units of measurement</span></h3>
<p>Acceleration has its own <a href="/Units_of_measurement" title="Units of measurement">units of measurement</a>. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared  (m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_words">Other words</span></h3>
<p>Acceleration can be <a href="/Positive" title="Positive">positive</a> or <a href="/Negative_number" title="Negative number">negative</a>. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word "acceleration".</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Newton.27s_second_law_of_motion">Newton's second law of motion</span></h2>
<p>Newton's laws of motion are <a href="/Rule" title="Rule">rules</a> for how things <a href="/Movement" title="Movement">move</a>. These rules are called "<a href="/Law" title="Law">laws</a> of <a href="/Motion_(physics)" title="Motion (physics)">motion</a>". <a href="/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> is the <a href="/Scientist" title="Scientist">scientist</a> who first wrote down the main laws of motion.
According to <a href="/Newton's_laws_of_motion#Second_Law" title="Newton's laws of motion">Newton's Second Law of Motion</a>, the <a href="/Force_(physics)" title="Force (physics)">force</a> something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a> (the amount of "stuff" the object is made from or how "heavy" it is).
The formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is <span class="math">\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}</span>,
where <span class="math">\mathbf{a}</span> is the acceleration, <span class="math">\mathbf{F}</span> is the force, and <span class="math">m</span> the mass. 
This formula is very well-known, and it is very important in <a href="/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short "Newton's Second Law", is often one of the first things that physics students learn.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Deceleration">Deceleration</span></h2>
<p>Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration. This means that something slows down instead of speeding up. For example, when a car brakes, it is decelerating.</p>
