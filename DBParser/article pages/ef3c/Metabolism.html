<p><b>Metabolism</b> is the name given to the <a href="/Chemical_reaction" title="Chemical reaction">chemical reactions</a> which keep us alive. It happens in the cells of living <a href="/Organisms" title="Organisms">organisms</a>.</p>
<p>Reactions <a href="/Catalysis" title="Catalysis">catalyzed</a> by <a href="/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word ‘metabolism’ can also refer to <a href="/Digestion" title="Digestion">digestion</a> and the transport of substances into and between different cells.</p>
<p>Metabolism is usually divided into two categories. <a href="/Catabolism" title="Catabolism">Catabolism</a> breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of <a href="/Cellular_respiration" title="Cellular respiration">cellular respiration</a>. <a href="/Anabolism" title="Anabolism">Anabolism</a> uses energy to construct <a href="/Molecules" title="Molecules">molecules</a> such as <a href="/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a> and <a href="/Nucleic_acid" title="Nucleic acid">nucleic acids</a>.</p>
<p>The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, or cycles, like the <a href="/Krebs_cycle" title="Krebs cycle">Krebs cycle</a>. One chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes.</p>
<p>The metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it finds <a href="/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutritious</a> and which <a href="/Poison" title="Poison">poisonous</a>. For example, some <a href="/Prokaryote" title="Prokaryote">prokaryotes</a> use <a href="/Hydrogen_sulfide" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Physiology1"><a href="#_note-Physiology1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The speed of metabolism, the <a href="/Metabolic_rate" title="Metabolic rate">metabolic rate</a>, influences how much food an organism will need, and how it is able to get that food.</p>
<p>A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> For example, the set of <a href="/Carboxylic_acid" title="Carboxylic acid">carboxylic acids</a> that are best known as the intermediates in the <a href="/Citric_acid_cycle" title="Citric acid cycle">citric acid cycle</a> are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the <a href="/Unicellular_organism" title="Unicellular organism">unicellular</a> bacterium <i><a href="/Escherichia_coli" title="Escherichia coli">Escherichia coli</a></i> and huge <a href="/Multicellular_organism" title="Multicellular organism">multicellular</a> organisms like <a href="/Elephant" title="Elephant">elephants</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-SmithE"><a href="#_note-SmithE" title="">[3]</a></sup> These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in the evolution of life, and kept because of their efficiency.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ebenhoh"><a href="#_note-Ebenhoh" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Cascante"><a href="#_note-Cascante" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
