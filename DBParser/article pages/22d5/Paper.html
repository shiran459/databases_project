<p>Modern <b>paper</b> is a thin <a href="/Material" title="Material">material</a> of (mostly) <a href="/Wood_fibre" title="Wood fibre">wood fibres</a> pressed together. People write on paper, and <a href="/Book" title="Book">books</a> are made of paper. Paper can absorb <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a> such as <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>, so people can clean things with paper.</p>
<p>The <b>pulp and paper industry</b> comprises companies that use wood as raw material and produce <a href="/Pulp_(paper)" title="Pulp (paper)">pulp</a>, paper, board and other cellulose-based products.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Paper_making">Paper making</span></h2>
<p>Modern paper is normally made from <a href="/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pulp">pulp</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Wood is ground up and mixed with <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> and other <a href="/Chemical" title="Chemical">chemicals</a> to make a thin liquid called "paper pulp". Paper pulp can be <a href="/Sodium_hypochlorite" title="Sodium hypochlorite">bleached</a> to make paper more white, and <a href="/Dye" title="Dye">dyes</a> can be added to make colored paper. This pulp is pressed into <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sheet">sheets</a> of paper. Printing is often done on paper before the paper is cut into sheets. Newsprint paper (newspaper) comes in a huge roll, and goes through the printing process as one continuous sheet. It is cut by a machine-driven <a href="/Guillotine" title="Guillotine">guillotine</a> blade later. Folding comes last, then packing for distribution. </p>
<p>Sometimes paper is made heavier and more glossy (shiny) by adding <a href="/Clay" title="Clay">clay</a>, and by 'milling' it. Milling is done by <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/squeeze">squeezing</a> the paper through a series of rollers. Sometimes paper is made from used or waste paper: this is <a href="/Recycling" title="Recycling">recycling</a>.</p>
<p>Not all paper is made from wood. Other kinds of fiber can be used. People still make paper from <a href="/Cotton" title="Cotton">cotton</a>, <a href="/Linen" title="Linen">linen</a> and <a href="/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a> for special purposes.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_paper">History of paper</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Writing" title="Writing">Writing</a> started long before the invention of paper. People wrote on many kinds of material. They wrote on cloth, on stone walls, on wood. In <a href="/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> the <a href="/Sumer" title="Sumer">Sumerians</a> wrote on <a href="/Clay" title="Clay">clay</a> tablets, many of which have survived today. In Europe, people wrote on <a href="/Vellum" title="Vellum">vellum</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_paper">First paper</span></h3>
<p>Many <a href="/Century" title="Century">centuries</a> ago – as early as the <a href="/3rd_millennium_BC" title="3rd millennium BC">3rd millennium BC</a> (that's over 2000 BC) – people in <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> made a kind of paper from the <a href="/Papyrus" title="Papyrus">papyrus</a> plant.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Skeat"><a href="#_note-Skeat" title="">[2]</a></sup> This is where the word 'paper' comes from. The people of <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> learned to do this too. The Romans wrote on <a href="/Parchment" title="Parchment">parchment</a> (made from animal skin), on <a href="/Wax" title="Wax">waxed</a> tablets and on wood (see <a href="/Vindolanda" title="Vindolanda">Vindolanda</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="/China" title="China">China</a> 105 AD, the <a href="/Eunuch" title="Eunuch">eunuch</a> <a href="/Cai_Lun" title="Cai Lun">Cai Lun</a> told his Emperor he had made paper. They had previously used <a href="/Bamboo" title="Bamboo">bamboo</a> and <a href="/Silk" title="Silk">silk</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-Carter"><a href="#_note-Carter" title="">[4]</a></sup> The material used in this ancient paper included <a href="/Cotton" title="Cotton">cotton</a> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rag">rags</a>, <a href="/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a>, various plant fibres and old <a href="/Fishing_net" title="Fishing net">fish nets</a>. The oldest existing paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a watchtower in the <a href="/Great_Wall_of_China" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall of China</a>. It dates to about 150 AD.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Carter_b"><a href="#_note-Carter" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup>p5</sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Even earlier paper (but with no writing on it) has been claimed: "The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world is made of hemp fibers, discovered in 1957 in a tomb near Xian, China, and dates from between the years 140 and 87 BC".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Paper-making was regarded by the Chinese as so valuable that they kept it secret as long as they could.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spread_of_paper">Spread of paper</span></h3>
<p>People in <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> learned how to make paper with fibres of the <a href="/Mulberry" title="Mulberry">mulberry</a> tree, around 610 AD. This is called Japanese paper or <i><a href="/Washi" title="Washi">Washi</a></i>. The Chinese invention spread to <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>, and then to the <a href="/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and then to <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>.</p>
<p>An opportunity occurred after The Battle of Talas in 751. Then an <a href="/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> army captured soldiers of the Chinese. There were some paper makers among the captured soldiers. From them, paper-making spread throughout the <a href="/Islamic_world" title="Islamic world">Islamic world</a>.  In 757, a paper mill was built at <a href="/Samarkand" title="Samarkand">Samarkand</a>. People learned to use <a href="/Linen" title="Linen">linen</a> as paper raw material and to use starch made from <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> as an additive.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italians</a> used <a href="/Hemp" title="Hemp">hemp</a> and <a href="/Linen" title="Linen">linen</a> rags. In 1276 the first Italian paper mill was built at <a href="/Fabriano" title="Fabriano">Fabriano</a> and, until the 14 century, Italy was a paper supplier in Europe. In 1282 the first <a href="/Watermark" title="Watermark">watermark</a> was introduced in <a href="/Bologna" title="Bologna">Bologna</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Machine-made_paper">Machine-made paper</span></h3>
<p>Paper was hard to make. It was cheaper than the old writing materials, but still expensive. A mechanical paper maker was conceived in <a href="/France" title="France">France</a> 1798, but invented in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. At least one <a href="/Paper_mill" title="Paper mill">paper mill</a> was using them by 1812.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Now the process was cheaper but the <a href="/Raw_material" title="Raw material">raw material</a> was still expensive.</p>
<p>In 1840 Friedrich Gottlob Keller Invented a machine that could make pulp for paper out of <a href="/Wood" title="Wood">wood</a> fibres (instead of the expensive rag paper). Paper became cheap enough for everyone to buy. Around the same time, other <a href="/Invention" title="Invention">inventions</a> were made, like the <a href="/Pencil" title="Pencil">pencil</a>, the <a href="/Fountain_pen" title="Fountain pen">fountain pen</a>, and a <a href="/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</a> that used <a href="/Steam_power" title="Steam power">steam power</a>. With this new <a href="/Information_technology" title="Information technology">information technology</a>, people wrote more letters, made more books and <a href="/Newspaper" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a>, and kept more records of what they did.</p>
<p>Today, some of the largest paper-producing countries are <a href="/China" title="China">China</a>, <a href="/USA" title="USA">USA</a>, <a href="/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Paper is produced in large factories called <i>paper mills</i>. They produce hundreds of thousands of tons of paper each year.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uses_of_paper">Uses of paper</span></h2>
