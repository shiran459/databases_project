<p>The <b>apple tree</b> (<i><a href="/Malus" title="Malus">Malus</a> domestica</i>) is a deciduous tree in the <a href="/Rosaceae" title="Rosaceae">rose family</a> best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the <b>apple</b>. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus <i>Malus.</i> The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, <i>Malus sieversii</i>, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.</p>
<p>Apple trees are large if grown from seed, but small if grafted onto roots (rootstock). There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Apples are generally propagated by grafting, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.</p>
<p>Worldwide production of apples in 2013 was 80.8 million tonnes, with China accounting for 49% of the total.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-faostat"><a href="#_note-faostat" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Apple_cultivars">Apple cultivars</span></h2>
<p>If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have <a href="/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also  have DNA from the apple flower that <a href="/Pollinate" title="Pollinate">pollinated</a> the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grow a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown <a href="/Stump" title="Stump">stump</a> called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed.</p>
<p>There are more than 7,500 known <a href="/Cultivar" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> of apples.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Elzebroek"><a href="#_note-Elzebroek" title="">[7]</a></sup> Different cultivars are available for <a href="/Temperate" title="Temperate">temperate</a> and <a href="/Subtropical" title="Subtropical">subtropical</a> climates. One large collection of over 2,100<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>. Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh (dessert apples). However, some are grown simply for cooking or making <a href="/Cider" title="Cider">cider</a>. Cider apples are usually too <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tart">tart</a> to eat immediately. However, they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-apples1"><a href="#_note-apples1" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
