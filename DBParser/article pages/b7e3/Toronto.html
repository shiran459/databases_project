<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Toronto was created in 1793 by <a href="/John_Graves_Simcoe" title="John Graves Simcoe">John Graves Simcoe</a> as the capital of what was then called <a href="/Upper_Canada" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a>. At the time it was called the "Town of <a href="/York" title="York">York</a>" after the <a href="/Duke_of_York" title="Duke of York">Duke of York</a>, but was given its current name in 1834. With the Canadian <a href="/Confederation" title="Confederation">Confederation</a> in 1867 it became the capital of the newly-created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with <a href="/Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> in <a href="/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>) that wanted to be the capital of Canada, but <a href="/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> decided that <a href="/Ottawa" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> should be the national capital as it was located between the two.</p>
<p>As the 19th century moved on, the city began to grow. This was mainly because of <a href="/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigration</a>, where people from all over the world left their home and <a href="/Immigration_to_Canada" title="Immigration to Canada">moved to Canada</a>. Many of the immigrants were <a href="/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish</a> and they brought their <a href="/Catholicism" title="Catholicism">Catholic faith</a> with them when they left <a href="/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> because of the <a href="/Irish_Potato_Famine" title="Irish Potato Famine">Irish Potato Famine</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Toronto had an important part in <a href="/Military" title="Military">military</a>, being used to train members of the <a href="/Canadian_Army" title="Canadian Army">Canadian Army</a>.

<p>By 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal.
