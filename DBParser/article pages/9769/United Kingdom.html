<p><a href="/Archaeology" title="Archaeology">Archaeological</a> remains show that the first group of people to live in the British Isles were hunter-gatherers after the last <a href="/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice age</a> ended. The date is not known: perhaps as early as 8000<small>BC</small> but certainly by 5000<small>BC</small>.

The Romans successfully invaded in 43<small>AD</small>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-14"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>{{see also|History of the United Kingdom}}
History begins when there is a written record. Writing was brought to Britain by the <a href="/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>. Rome ruled in Britain from 44AD to 410AD, but they only ruled England and Wales. The Romans never ruled Scotland north of the Clyde-Forth valley, or Ireland; their northern boundary varied from time to time, and was marked for a while at <a href="/Hadrian's_Wall" title="Hadrian's Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>.</p>
<p>After the Romans, two waves of <a href="/Immigration" title="Immigration">immigrants</a> came to Britain. The first were <a href="/Germanic_peoples" title="Germanic peoples">German</a> tribes: the <a href="/Angles" title="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="/Saxons" title="Saxons">Saxons</a> and <a href="/Jutes" title="Jutes">Jutes</a>. <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a>, the language, is a development from <a href="/Anglo-Saxon" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="/Old_English" title="Old English">Old English</a>, and is a Germanic language.  The second were the <a href="/Viking" title="Viking">Vikings</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Britain_unified">Britain unified</span></h3>
<p>After a long period when <a href="/England" title="England">England</a> was split into various kingdoms, it was made into one country by Æthelstan (<a href="/Athelstan" title="Athelstan">Athelstan</a>) in 945<small>AD</small>. England and Wales were unified by <a href="/Edward_I_of_England" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a> (Longshanks) by force in the 13th century.</p>
<p>Union with Scotland took much longer; there were hundreds of years of conflicts between both parts of Britain. This union between England and Scotland in 1707 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged Scotland and England into one country.</p>
<p>In 1603, when <a href="/Queen" title="Queen">Queen</a> <a href="/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a> died, her closest relative was <a href="/King" title="King">King</a> <a href="/James_I_of_England" title="James I of England">James VI of Scotland</a>. He became king of England as well as king of Scotland. In 1707, the Scottish and English Parliaments agreed the Treaty of Union, which joined the two countries into one country called <i>The Kingdom of Great Britain</i> under Queen <a href="/Anne_of_Great_Britain" title="Anne of Great Britain">Anne</a>.
</p>


<p>By 1800, both Scotland and England had already independently had much influence over <a href="/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> since 1200. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states. The new country was called the <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</i>. In 1922 much of Ireland became independent as the <a href="/Irish_Free_State" title="Irish Free State">Irish Free State</a> (now called <a href="/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties (called <a href="/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>) continue to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed <i>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Parliament">Parliament</span></h3>
<p>The British people are ruled by <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">Parliament</a>, not by monarchs. Parliament started in 1215 as an advisory body for the monarch, but by the 17th century it had gained enough power to successfully defeat <a href="/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>, in the <a href="/English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>. <a href="/Oliver_Cromwell" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> became Lord Protector. Though the monarchy was restored after his death, the Crown slowly became the secondary power, and Parliament the first. Members of Parliament (called MPs) were elected, but until the early twentieth century, only men who owned property could vote. In the nineteenth century, more people were given <a href="/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a> (the right to vote), but even so, by 1900, women could not vote, and only 40% of men were rich enough to vote. But in 1928, all adults, male and female, got the vote: this is called universal suffrage.</p>
<p>Parliament is in London, but it has power over the whole of the UK. Today, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own parliaments as well, but they have more limited powers. There are also parliaments in the <a href="/Isle_of_Man" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> and the <a href="/Channel_Islands" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>, which are islands that are partly controlled by the UK, and partly independent.</p>
<p>The members of Parliament belong to <a href="/Political_party" title="Political party">political parties</a>: the biggest parties are the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. Members of the same party agree to act and vote more or less together. A party with more than half the seats (a majority) forms the government; the leader of the party becomes the <a href="/Prime_Minister" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a>, who then appoints other ministers. Because the government has a majority in Parliament, it can normally control what laws are passed.</p>

<p>The UK is north-west off the coast of mainland <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Around the UK are the <a href="/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, the <a href="/English_Channel" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> and the <a href="/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The UK also rules, usually indirectly, a number of smaller places (mostly islands) round the world, which are known as <i>overseas territories</i>. They are remnants of the  <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a> of the United Kingdom is changeable and unpredictable. Summers are moderately warm, winters are cool to cold. Rain falls throughout the year, and more on the west than the east because of its northerly latitude and the warm water from the <a href="/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>'s <a href="/Gulf_Stream" title="Gulf Stream">Gulf Stream</a>. The usually moderate prevailing winds from the Atlantic may be interrupted by <a href="/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> air from the north-east or hot air from the <a href="/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics">Politics</span></h2>


<p>The UK is a <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">parliamentary</a> <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> based on a <a href="/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional</a> and <a href="/Hereditary_monarchy" title="Hereditary monarchy">hereditary monarchy</a>. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a <a href="/Member_of_Parliament" title="Member of Parliament">members of Parliament</a> to speak for them and to make laws for them. Queen <a href="/Elizabeth_II" title="Elizabeth II">Elizabeth II</a> is the <a href="/Monarch" title="Monarch">queen</a> of the UK and is the <a href="/Head_of_state" title="Head of state">head of state</a>. Even though she is the head of state, she does not actually govern the country. The <a href="/Government" title="Government">government</a>, led by the <a href="/Prime_Minister" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a>, governs the country and decides <a href="/Policy" title="Policy">policy</a>. Today, the Prime Minister is <a href="/Theresa_May" title="Theresa May">Theresa May</a>, who is the leader of the Conservative <a href="/Political_party" title="Political party">party</a> and was not directly elected by the people of the country.</p>
<p><a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> is where laws are made.

The House of Commons is the most powerful part. It is where Members of Parliament sit. The Prime Minister sits here as well, because they are a Member of Parliament. The people who sit in the House of Lords are called peers: they are not chosen by the people. Most peers are now appointed by the government. There are some who are hereditary <a href="/Peerage" title="Peerage">peers</a> (their fathers were peers); and a few others, such as certain <a href="/Bishop" title="Bishop">bishops</a> in the established <a href="/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, and the <a href="/Judiciary" title="Judiciary">Judiciary</a> (Law Lords).</p>
<p>Scotland has its own devolved Parliament with power to make laws on things like education, health and Scottish law. Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies which have some powers but less than the Scottish parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Military">Military</span></h2>
<p>The UK has a military of around 223,000 people, not including reserve forces. The UK has one of the most advanced military in the world, alongside such countries such as the <a href="/USA" title="USA">USA</a> and <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>, and operates a large army (<a href="/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a>), a sizable navy (<a href="/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>) and air force (<a href="/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>). From the 18th century to the early 20th century, the UK was one of the most powerful nations in the world, with a huge navy (due to the fact it was surrounded by sea, so a large navy was the most practical option). This status has faded in recent times, but the UK remains a member of various military groups such as the <a href="/United_Nations_Security_Council" title="United Nations Security Council">UN Security Council</a> and <a href="/NATO" title="NATO">NATO</a>. It is also still seen as a great military power.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
<p>The UK is a <a href="/Development" title="Development">developed</a> country with the sixth largest <a href="/Economy" title="Economy">economy</a> in the world. It was a <a href="/Superpower" title="Superpower">superpower</a> during the 18th, 19th and early 20th century and was considered since the early 1800s to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world, in politics, economics (For it was the wealthiest country at the time.) and in military strength. Britain continued to be the biggest manufacturing economy in the world until 1908 and the largest economy until the 1920s. The economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> in the 1950s and 1960s reduced its leading role in global affairs. The UK has strong economic, cultural, military and political influence and is a <a href="/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>. It is a member state of the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> at the moment, but is planning on leaving after brexit was voted for.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h2>
<p>England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have separate, but similar, systems of education. They all have rules that education is required from ages five to eighteen, except for in Scotland where school departure is allowed from the age of sixteen. Many children attend state schools and other children attend private schools.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transport">Transport</span></h2>
<p>Road traffic in the United Kingdom drives on the left hand side of the road (unlike the Americas and some of the rest of Europe), and the driver steers from the right hand side of the vehicle. The road network on the island of <a href="/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> is extensive, with most local and rural roads having evolved from Roman and Medieval times. Major routes developed in the mid 20th Century were made to the needs of the motor car. The high speed <a href="/Motorway" title="Motorway">motorway</a> (freeway) network was mostly constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and links together major towns and cities.</p>
<p>The system of <a href="/Rail_transport" title="Rail transport">rail transport</a> was invented in England and Wales, so the United Kingdom has the oldest <a href="/Railway" title="Railway">railway</a> network in the world. It was built mostly during the Victorian era. At the heart of the network are five long distance main lines which radiate from <a href="/London" title="London">London</a> to the major cities and secondary population centres with dense commuter networks within the regions. The newest part of the network connects London to the Channel Tunnel from St Pancras station and is built to the same standard as the French TGV system. The <a href="/British_Rail" title="British Rail">British Rail</a> network is part privatised, with privately owned train operating companies providing service along particular lines or regions, whilst the tracks, signals and stations are owned by a Government controlled company called Network Rail. In Northern Ireland the <a href="/NI_Railways" title="NI Railways">NI Railways</a> is the national railway. The system of underground railways in London, known as the <a href="/London_Underground" title="London Underground">Tube</a>, has been copied by many other cities.</p>
<p>Most domestic <a href="/Air_travel" title="Air travel">air travel</a> in the United Kingdom is between London and the major cities in Scotland and the North of England. <a href="/London_Heathrow_Airport" title="London Heathrow Airport">London-Heathrow</a> is the nation’s largest airport and is one of the most important international <a href="/Airline_hub" title="Airline hub">hubs</a> in the world. Other major airports with principal international service include London-Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow.</p>
<p>An extensive system of <a href="/Ferry" title="Ferry">ferry</a> networks operate between the Scottish islands, and major ferry routes operate between England and France (via the English Channel), Scotland-Northern Ireland (via the Irish Sea) and England/Wales-Republic of Ireland (from Liverpool/Holyhead).</p>
