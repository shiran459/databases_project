A <b>gun</b> (also called a <b>firearm</b>) is a <a href="/Weapon" title="Weapon">weapon</a> used to shoot one or more metal <a href="/Projectile" title="Projectile">projectiles</a> called <a href="/Bullet" title="Bullet">bullets</a>. Guns guns made of wood or bamboo are thought to have been invented in <a href="/China" title="China">China</a> around 1000 AD. In the next few centuries they spread to other parts of Asia and to Europe where they were made of <a href="/Metal" title="Metal">metal</a>. Guns largely replaced <a href="/Catapult" title="Catapult">catapults</a> and <a href="/Archery" title="Archery">bows and arrows</a> when they became strong enough to reach out over longer distances to kill. They are of many different sizes. Some are small enough to hold in one hand. Others are large enough to sink a <a href="/Warship" title="Warship">warship</a>.</p>

<p>Guns that are small enough to be carried and used by one person have the same basic parts: a <a href="/Trigger_(firearms)" title="Trigger (firearms)">trigger</a>, a <a href="/Barrel_(weapons)" title="Barrel (weapons)">barrel</a>, and a handgrip or <a href="/Stock_(firearm)" title="Stock (firearm)">stock</a>. The trigger is pulled by a <a href="/Finger" title="Finger">finger</a> to <a href="/Gunshot" title="Gunshot">fire</a> the weapon which releases a bullet. The barrel guides the bullet which then flies to the <a href="/Bullseye_(sports)" title="Bullseye (sports)">target</a>. The handgrip is held by the human who will fire the gun. In <a href="/Military" title="Military">military</a> terms, the more correct word "firearm" is used for the type of weapons that soldiers carry: <a href="/Pistol" title="Pistol">pistols</a> (known as 'shorts') and <a href="/Rifle" title="Rifle">rifles</a> ('longs'). Guns can be very effective <a href="/Weapon" title="Weapon">weapons</a>. Some guns fire bullets at a very high speed, which is much more deadly than an <a href="/Arrow" title="Arrow">arrow</a> or <a href="/Spear" title="Spear">spear</a>. They are also more effective at greater distances than arrows or spears. Bullets are usually non-explosive pieces of metal. </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cartridges">Cartridges</span></h2>
<p>A modern bullet is the front part of a <i>round</i> or <a href="/Cartridge_(firearms)" title="Cartridge (firearms)">cartridge</a>. A cartridge consists of a <i>bullet</i>, <a href="/Propellant" title="Propellant">propellant</a> and a <a href="/Primer_(firearm)" title="Primer (firearm)">primer</a>. These are packaged in a <a href="/Metal" title="Metal">metallic</a>, <a href="/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>, or <a href="/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> case which is sized exactly for the <a href="/Chamber_(firearms)" title="Chamber (firearms)">chamber</a> of the firearm being used. When the rear of the case (containing the primer) is struck, an explosion in the back of the cartridge ignites the propellant. The controlled explosion forces the bullet out of the barrel. Cartridges have different ways of being loaded into different kinds of weapons. Cartridges can be loaded directly into a firearm into the chamber. Or, more commonly, into a <a href="/Clip_(firearms)" title="Clip (firearms)">clip</a>, a <a href="/Magazine_(firearms)" title="Magazine (firearms)">magazine</a> or other bullet container which is loaded into the firearm. Handguns known as <a href="/Revolver" title="Revolver">revolvers</a> have a <a href="/Cylinder" title="Cylinder">cylinder</a> with holes that the bullets are loaded into. Modern guns called <a href="/Pistol" title="Pistol">pistols</a> are handguns loaded with a magazine and are called <i>automatic loading</i>.</p>

Guns have been used by armies since about the <a href="/14th_century" title="14th century">14th century</a>. Long barreled guns called <a href="/Musket" title="Musket">muskets</a>, that could be carried and used by one person, were in use by 1350.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  They became an important weapon in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">European</a> armies about the 1600s. </p>
<p>Modern militaries use the word "gun" for larger <a href="/Artillery" title="Artillery">artillery</a> guns that need several people, and that fire big ammunition. For example, weapons on <a href="/Warship" title="Warship">warships</a> and <a href="/Tank" title="Tank">tanks</a> are called "guns". They may be in a "turret" (a rotating base). Big guns usually fire <a href="/Shell_(projectile)" title="Shell (projectile)">artillery shells</a>, which explode upon impact. </p>
<p>In almost every country firearms are the main weapons used by armies. In modern armies, every <a href="/Soldier" title="Soldier">soldier</a> has at least one firearm as standard equipment. Soldiers are <a href="/Training" title="Training">trained</a> to use firearms, and to keep them clean and ready for use. </p>

<p> Shooting is a competitive sport involving tests of accuracy and speed. They use various types of <a href="/Gun" title="Gun">guns</a> such as pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns and <a href="/Air_gun" title="Air gun">airguns</a>. Shooting sports are categorized by the type of firearm, targets, and distances at which the targets are shot. Target Shooting is an <a href="/Olympic_Games" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> sport. </p>
<p>Since the first <a href="/Human" title="Human">humans</a>, hunting became a way of life.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> It was and still is in some places, the key to <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/survival">survival</a>. Mankind is distinguished from other animals by the use of tools.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> At least 2 <a href="/Million" title="Million">million</a> years ago man learned to hunt animals for meat.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> They learned to create and use spears and axes. Bows and arrows were used at least 71,000 years ago.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Modern hunting still uses more primitive tools. But many <a href="/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">subsistence hunters</a> have adapted to use modern firearms. In modern countries hunting is still allowed but is considered a sport. Hunting can be used to control the populations of many animal species. As with many aspects of gun ownership and use, modern hunting remains controversial.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Handguns are not generally used for hunting.</p>

<p>Guns can be used to kill other people. For that reason many <a href="/Country" title="Country">countries</a> only allow <a href="/Soldier" title="Soldier">soldiers</a>, <a href="/Police" title="Police">policemen</a>, and certain <a href="/Social_class" title="Social class">social classes</a> to have them. In some countries, a person must have a special <a href="/Permit" title="Permit">permit</a> (or license) if they want to own a gun. Depending on the gun, people need to be a certain age and may need to meet other <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/criteria">criteria</a> to get such a permit. An example of this is that in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> <a href="/Law_of_the_United_States" title="Law of the United States">federal law</a> allows the purchase of rifles and/or shotguns at age 18—if purchased from a licensed firearms dealer.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-LawCent"><a href="#_note-LawCent" title="">[7]</a></sup> But a person must be age 21 or older to purchase a handgun—from a licensed firearms dealer.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-LawCent_b"><a href="#_note-LawCent" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, if purchased from an unlicensed person, with few <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exception">exceptions</a>, a handgun may not be sold to anyone under age 18.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-LawCent_c"><a href="#_note-LawCent" title="">[7]</a></sup> There is no age restriction on who may buy a rifle or shotgun from an unlicensed person.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-LawCent_d"><a href="#_note-LawCent" title="">[7]</a></sup> In the United States and other countries, people can buy guns for <a href="/Self-defense" title="Self-defense">self-defense</a>, <a href="/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a>, and <a href="/Shooting_sport" title="Shooting sport">shooting sports</a> like target shooting. In some countries, such as <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, people who live on farms are allowed to keep guns, but it is not easy for a person living in the city to get a gun without good reason. In the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, access by the general public to firearms is tightly controlled by law. However, this is less restrictive in <a href="/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.
