<p>An <b>experiment</b> is a test of an <a href="/Idea" title="Idea">idea</a> or a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/method">method</a>. It is often used by <a href="/Scientist" title="Scientist">scientists</a> and <a href="/Engineer" title="Engineer">engineers</a>.  An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world.  Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of <a href="/Scientific_method" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>.</p>
<p>Experiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When <a href="/Einstein" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> said that <a href="/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> could affect <a href="/Light" title="Light">light</a>, it took a few years before <a href="/Astronomers" title="Astronomers">astronomers</a> could test it. <a href="/General_relativity" title="General relativity">General relativity</a> predicts that the path of light is bent in a <a href="/Gravitational_field" title="Gravitational field">gravitational field</a>; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant <a href="/Quasar" title="Quasar">quasars</a> being deflected as it passes the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, a hundred years or so after Einstein published his ideas, there have been many tests, all of which have been consistent with Einstein's predictions. But, one day, we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work. What we test are <a href="/Implication_(grammar)" title="Implication (grammar)">implications</a> of the theory, because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once.</p>
