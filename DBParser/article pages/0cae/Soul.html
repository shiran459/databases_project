<p>In popular culture, soul usually means deep feeling and commitment. It is in this sense that the word appears in the term <a href="/Soul_music" title="Soul music">soul music</a>. However that music was also influenced by <a href="/Gospel_music" title="Gospel music">gospel music</a> which was religious.</p>
<p>One popular idea about souls that is easy to express, is that a person <i>is</i> a soul, and <i>has</i> a body.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The soul is the "I" in "I exist" that feels and lives life. What people call the <a href="/Mind" title="Mind">mind</a> could be <i>part</i> of the soul: one soul started this article, other souls have edited it, and another soul is reading it. This view, however, implies that the <a href="/Human_body" title="Human body">human body</a> is a possession, and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker (some people say that <a href="/Animal" title="Animal">animals</a>, <a href="/Heretic" title="Heretic">heretics</a>, and people of another <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religion</a> do not have souls). Like most uses of the verb <a href="/To_be" title="To be">to be</a>, there is an ideology in these simple words.</p>
<p>Christianity teaches that all humans have an immortal soul.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mayled"><a href="#_note-mayled" title="">[2]</a></sup> This means that it is a part of them which does not die when their physical body dies, but lives on with them to <a href="/Heaven" title="Heaven">heaven</a> or to <a href="/Hell" title="Hell">hell</a>. Christians believe that the soul is the 'breath of life' which God gave to Adam.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mayled_b"><a href="#_note-mayled" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> the soul is believed to weigh 21 grams. This belief may have been influenced by the observations of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_MacDougall_(doctor)">Dr. McDougall</a> in the early 1900s.{{cn|date=June 2013}} </p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics">Characteristics</span></h3>
<p>One distinction often made is between soul, which is distinct from other souls, and <a href="/Spirit" title="Spirit">spirit</a> which may be combined with that of other beings. The idea of the <a href="/Holy_Spirit" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> in <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, for example, is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of, and which is expressed on Earth in that faith by "the Church" meaning "the body of Christ" meaning "all bodies that follow Jesus." This could be more inclusive than the is/has view of souls and bodies.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reincarnation">Reincarnation</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a> is a belief that says that after the body dies, the soul will be born again in another body.</p>
