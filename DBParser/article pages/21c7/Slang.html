<p><b>Slang</b> are words that are  <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/informal">informal</a>.  Usually each <a href="/Generation" title="Generation">generation</a> or social group has its own slang - for example, older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people.  On the other hand, younger people often understand, but find silly or old-fashioned, the slang of older people.</p>
<p>Over time, <a href="/Language" title="Language">language</a> tends to get more complex, since new <a href="/Word" title="Word">words</a> enter much faster than old words leave.  Over time, slang almost always becomes part of the language, and approved for use by all.</p>
<p>It has also happened that some words used in <a href="/Anglo-Saxon" title="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> for bodily functions became thought of as <a href="/Profanity" title="Profanity">profanity</a> or rude after they were replaced by <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latinate</a> words like "urinate", "defecate" and "copulate" - which polite people were supposed to use after the <a href="/Norman_conquest_of_England" title="Norman conquest of England">Norman conquest of England</a> in <a href="/1066" title="1066">1066</a>.  This was in part a way of making poor people (who spoke Anglo-Saxon) all appear to be rude, while more powerful people (who spoke Norman) appeared to be polite - one way that <a href="/Etiquette" title="Etiquette">etiquette</a> can develop, and reinforce <a href="/Power_structure" title="Power structure">power structure</a>.  This is only one example from <a href="/History" title="History">history</a> of how <a href="/Racism" title="Racism">racism</a> can be a reason for defining one group's language as 'slang' and another as 'correct'.</p>
<p>Wanting to have rules of <a href="/Grammar" title="Grammar">grammar</a> that do not change and the same <a href="/Vocabulary" title="Vocabulary">vocabulary</a> used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group's language as correct.</p>
<p>An "<a href="/Idiom" title="Idiom">idiom</a>" can be slang, but it can also be a <a href="/Metaphor" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a> that becomes part of the culture.</p>
<p>Two examples of slang are 'wassup' and 'dunnoe'. 'Wassup' usually means 'What is up?' (as in, 'How are you?'), and 'dunnow' usually means 'I don't know'.</p>
<p>Some of the "Homies" in the hood day spell Icup. This mostly means that one is watching another use the toilet. THis is a slang used in "da hood" as a way to insult one another.</p>
