<p>Quebec was part of <a href="/New_France" title="New France">New France</a> until 1760, then under <a href="/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British control</a>. Quebec became a province in the Canadian Confederation in 1867. Since then, some people in Quebec have wanted to leave Canada. Since Quebec is a mainly French-speaking province, most of the people there feel that it is very different from the rest of Canada, and want to keep it that way. Some feel that for this to happen, Quebec must <a href="/Succession" title="Succession">leave Canada</a> and become its own <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a>. However, the people of Quebec are still divided as to its place in Canada. </p>
<p>Quebec held <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democratic</a> <a href="/Vote" title="Vote">votes</a> in 1980 and 1995 to decide whether to leave Canada. In 1995, the people of Quebec chose to stay in Canada by a 1% margin.</p>
