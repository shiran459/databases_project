<p>A <b>monarch</b> is a person who rules because one of their relatives ruled.  A <a href="/Male" title="Male">male</a> monarch can be a <a href="/King" title="King">king</a> or <a href="/Emperor" title="Emperor">emperor</a>. A female monarch can be called a <a href="/Queen" title="Queen">queen</a> or <a href="/Empress" title="Empress">empress</a>.</p>
<p>This is <a href="/Monarchy" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, a system of ruling in which ruling starts by a member of a family, and continues in that family as a <a href="/Dynasty" title="Dynasty">dynasty</a>.
Monarchs were very common in <a href="/History" title="History">history</a>.  Many <a href="/Country" title="Country">countries</a> used to have a monarch, but no longer have them. Some countries that still have monarchs have other <a href="/Leader" title="Leader">leaders</a> that actually have the power.</p>
<p>Monarchs tended to have monarchs of lower honour below them, e.g. a <a href="/Empire" title="Empire">Empire</a> could include several <a href="/Kingdom" title="Kingdom">kingdoms</a>, and a kingdom would have several duchies or principalities, nations would rarely include all titles, usually going from <a href="/Duchy" title="Duchy">duchy</a> to kingdom instead of duchy to principality to kingdom.  Prince/<a href="/Princess" title="Princess">Princess</a> means 'Ruler of a Principality' and 'son of king/queen'.  Some other languages have separate words for them.</p>
