<p>A <b>deadline</b> is a <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a> by which some <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/task">task</a> must be <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complete">completed</a>.</p>
<p>Very often, it means a <a href="/Time_limit" title="Time limit">time limit</a> that is set in place by an <a href="/Authority" title="Authority">authority</a> - for example, a <a href="/Teacher" title="Teacher">teacher</a> tells students that they must turn in their <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homework">homework</a> in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her <a href="/Principal" title="Principal">principal</a> that every <a href="/Student" title="Student">student</a> had the same chance to do the work.</p>
<p>Deadlines may also be set by a <a href="/Time_horizon" title="Time horizon">time horizon</a> that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of <a href="/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a>.  For example, by <a href="/Sunset" title="Sunset">sunset</a> one must do those tasks requiring <a href="/Daylight" title="Daylight">daylight</a>.  However, a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight, so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself.</p>
<p>A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">physical</a> <a href="/Horizon" title="Horizon">horizon</a> where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this. A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things.</p>
