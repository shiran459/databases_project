The <b>Soviet Union</b> (short for <b>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</b> or <b>USSR</b>) <sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> was a single-party Marxist-Leninist state, led by the communist party. It existed from 1922 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of 14 Soviet Socialist Republics and 1 Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Soviet Russia).</p>
<p>Soviet Russia was created in 1917 after <a href="/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> led the overthrow of <a href="/Alexander_Kerensky" title="Alexander Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a>. Soviet Russia joined Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, and Ukraine in 1922 to form the Soviet Union. The communist government developed <a href="/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a> and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, and <a href="/Kazakhstan" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> was the second. The <a href="/Capital_city" title="Capital city">capital city</a> of Soviet Russia and the Union was <a href="/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>.  Although technically countries could become independent if they wanted, in practice it was a completely centralized government, with no <a href="/States'_rights" title="States' rights">states' rights</a> for the member countries. Many believe that the Soviet Union was the final stage of the <a href="/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>; since the USSR covered most of the land of the former Empire.</p>
<p>The Union was formed with the professed idea to give everyone equal social and economic rights. There was virtually no private property - everything belonged to the state. "Soviets", or workers' councils were created to speak for the workers, and served as an elite group to govern them. It was successful in many fields; putting the first man and satellite into space and winning World War II alongside the United States and <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. However, its centralized government found <a href="/Innovation" title="Innovation">innovation</a> and change difficult to handle. The union collapsed in 1991, partly due to the efforts at reform by its leader, <a href="/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union was made of 15 republics. These were either <i>Soviet Socialist Republics</i>, or <i>Soviet Socialist Federal Republics</i>. Each of these republics was independent. They reserved the right to leave the union, which they did in 1991. </p>
<p>The <i>Federal Republics</i> were different in that they had more autonomy, and were made up of states themselves. These were often called <i>Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics</i>. There were a number of them. Most of them still exist; though they are now republics, within the independent state. The <i><a href="/Tatar" title="Tatar">Tatar</a> ASSR</i> turned into the <i>Republic of <a href="/Tatarstan" title="Tatarstan">Tatarstan</a></i>, for example (It is located around <a href="/Kazan" title="Kazan">Kazan</a>). </p>

<p>Extreme government-changing activity in the Russian Empire began with the <a href="/Decembrist_Revolt" title="Decembrist Revolt">Decembrist Revolt</a> of 1825, and although <a href="/Serfdom" title="Serfdom">serfdom</a> was removed in 1861, its removal was achieved on terms unfavorable to the peasants (poor agricultural workers) and served to encourage changers (revolutionaries). A parliament (<a href="/Legislative" title="Legislative">legislative</a> assembly)—the <a href="/State_Duma" title="State Duma">State Duma</a>—was created in 1906 after the <a href="/Russian_Revolution_of_1905" title="Russian Revolution of 1905">Russian Revolution of 1905</a>, but the Tsar protested people trying to move from <a href="/Absolute_monarchy" title="Absolute monarchy">absolute</a> to <a href="/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. Rebellion continued and was aggravated during <a href="/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> by failure and food shortages in popular cities.
</p>


<p>A rebellion in <a href="/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, caused the "<a href="/February_Revolution" title="February Revolution">February Revolution</a>" and the <a href="/Russian_Revolution_(1917)" title="Russian Revolution (1917)">removal of the government in March 1917</a>. The tsarist <a href="/Autocracy" title="Autocracy">autocracy</a> was replaced by the Russian "<a href="/Provisional_government" title="Provisional government">Provisional government</a>", whose leaders intended to have elections to Russian <a href="/Constituent_Assembly" title="Constituent Assembly">Constituent Assembly</a> and to continue war on the side of the <a href="/Allies_of_World_War_I" title="Allies of World War I">Entente</a> in World War I.</p>
<p>At the same time, workers' councils, known as <a href="/Soviet_(council)" title="Soviet (council)">Soviets</a>, sprang up across the country.  The <a href="/Bolshevik" title="Bolshevik">Bolsheviks</a>, led by <a href="/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, pushed for <a href="/Socialist" title="Socialist">socialist</a> revolution in the Soviets and on the streets. In November 1917, during the "<a href="/October_Revolution" title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a>", they took power from the Provisional Government.  In December, the Bolsheviks signed an <a href="/Armistice" title="Armistice">armistice</a> (peace) with the <a href="/Central_Powers" title="Central Powers">Central Powers</a>.  In March, after more fighting, the Soviets quit the war for good and signed the <a href="/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk" title="Treaty of Brest-Litovsk">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a>.</p>
<p>In the long and bloody <a href="/Russian_Civil_War" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a> the new Soviet power won.  The civil war between the <a href="/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Reds</a> and the <a href="/White_movement" title="White movement">Whites</a> started in 1917 and ended in 1923.

<p>The big changes of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917.

It included the making of a network of 30 regional <a href="/Power_station" title="Power station">power stations</a>, including ten large <a href="/Hydroelectric" title="Hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> power plants, and numerous electric-powered large industrial organizations. The Plan became the prototype for subsequent <a href="/Five-Year_Plan_(USSR)" title="Five-Year Plan (USSR)">Five-Year Plans</a> and was basically fulfilled by 1931.</p>

<p>
From its beginning years, government in the Soviet Union was ruled as a <a href="/One-party_state" title="One-party state">one-party state</a> by the <a href="/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Communist Party of the Soviet Union">Communist Party (Bolsheviks)</a>. After the economic policy of <a href="/War_Communism" title="War Communism">War Communism</a> during the Civil War, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist with nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax (<i>see</i> <a href="/New_Economic_Policy" title="New Economic Policy">New Economic Policy</a>).</p>
<p>Soviet leaders argued that one-party rule was necessary because it ensured that 'capitalist exploitation' would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of <a href="/Democratic_Centralism" title="Democratic Centralism">Democratic Centralism</a> would represent the people's will. Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for Soviet leaders to take more power in the years after Lenin's death in 1924. Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a "<a href="/Troika" title="Troika">troika</a>" composed of <a href="/Grigory_Zinoviev" title="Grigory Zinoviev">Grigory Zinoviev</a> of <a href="/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="/Lev_Kamenev" title="Lev Kamenev">Lev Kamenev</a> of <a href="/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, and <a href="/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> of <a href="/Georgian_people" title="Georgian people">Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>Stalin led the country through <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and into the <a href="/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. <a href="/Gulag" title="Gulag">Gulag</a> camps greatly expanded to take millions of prisoners.  After he died, <a href="/Georgy_Malenkov" title="Georgy Malenkov">Georgy Malenkov</a>, one of the few top officials he didn't kill, continued his policies. <a href="/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> reversed some of Stalin's policies but <a href="/Leonid_Brezhnev" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> and <a href="/Alexei_Kosygin" title="Alexei Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a> kept things as they were.  </p>
<p>After the 1936 revised constitution, the Soviet Union stopped acting as a union of republics and more as a single super-country.</p>

<p><a href="/Leonid_Brezhnev" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> led the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982.  He came to power after he convinced the government to overthrow the then-leader <a href="/Nikita_Krushchev" title="Nikita Krushchev">Nikita Krushchev</a>. Brezhnev's rule is often linked with the decline in Soviet economy and starting the chain of events that would lead to the union's eventual collapse. He had many self-awarded medals.  He was awarded <a href="/Hero_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="Hero of the Soviet Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a> (the highest honor) on three separate occasions. Brezhnev was succeeded by <a href="/Yuri_Andropov" title="Yuri Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, who died a few years later.  Andropov was succeeded by the frail and aging <a href="/Konstantin_Chernenko" title="Konstantin Chernenko">Konstantin Chernenko</a>.  Chernenko died a mere year after taking office.</p>
<p>In 1980 the Soviet Union hosted the <a href="/Summer_Olympics" title="Summer Olympics">Summer Olympics</a> with Brezhnev opening and closing the games.  The games were heavily boycotted by the western nations, particularly the United States.  During the closing ceremony, the flag of the City of Los Angeles was raised instead of the flag of the United States (to symbolise the next host city/nation) and the anthem of the Olympics was played instead of the anthem of the United states in response to the boycott. </p>
<p>Brezhnev was the second longest serving Soviet leader after Stalin. The Following is a list of leaders (General Secretary of the Communist Party) in order of their tenure and length of leadership:

<p>Khrushchev and Gorbachev are the only Soviet leaders to have not died whilst in office. Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev are the only leaders who were not (de jure) head of state during their leaderships.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Gorbachev.27s_rule">Gorbachev's rule</span></h2>


<p>
<a href="/Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> was the Soviet Union's last leader. He was the only Soviet leader to have been born after the October revolution and was thus a product of the Soviet Union having grown up in it. He and <a href="/USA" title="USA">US</a> president <a href="/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> signed a treaty to get rid of some <a href="/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>. Gorbachev started social and economic reforms that gave people <a href="/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>; which allowed them to criticise the government and its policies. The ruling communist party lost its grip on the media and the people. Newspapers began printing the many failures that the Soviet Union had covered up and denied in its past. The Soviet Union's economy was lagging and the government was spending a lot of money on competing with the west.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dissolution">Dissolution</span></h2>
<p>By the 1980s the Soviet economy was suffering but it was stable.  Gorbachev's new ideas had got out of hand and the communist party lost control. Boris Yeltsin was elected (democratically) the President of the <a href="/Russian_SFSR" title="Russian SFSR">Russian SFSR</a> even though Gorbachev did not want him to come into power. <a href="/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> announced its independence from the Union and the Soviet government demanded it surrender its independence or it would send the <a href="/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> to keep order. Gorbachev came up with the idea to keep the Soviet Union together with each republic would be more independent but under the same leader. He wanted to call it the 'Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics' to keep the USSR/Soviet Union title and the CCCP in Russian.</p>
<p>A group of communists (unhappy with Gorbachev's idea) tried to take over <a href="/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and stop the Soviet Union from collapsing.  It only made people want independence more. Although he survived the attempted takeover, he lost all of his power outside of Moscow.  <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> declared independence in December 1991.  Later in the month, leaders of Russia, <a href="/Belarus" title="Belarus">Byelorussia</a> and <a href="/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> signed a treaty called the Belavezha Agreement to dissolve the USSR; angering Gorbachev.  It was agreed that the USSR government must end operations by January 1st, 1992.  The Soviet Union's parliament (Supreme Soviet) ratified the Belavezha Accords law in a 45 minute session in the Kremlin on December 26th, 1991, marking the dissolution of the Soviet Government, and Soviet Union. The day before, December 25th, 1991, the red flag was lowered from the Kremlin, ending 74 years of soviet rule in Russia.</p>
