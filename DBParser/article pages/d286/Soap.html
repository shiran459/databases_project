<b>Soap</b> is a <a href="/Chemical_compound" title="Chemical compound">chemical compound</a> resulting from the reaction of an alkali (commonly <a href="/Sodium_hydroxide" title="Sodium hydroxide">sodium</a> or <a href="/Potassium_hydroxide" title="Potassium hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>) with a fatty acid. When mixed with <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> during <a href="/Bath" title="Bath">bathing</a> or <a href="/Washing" title="Washing">washing</a>, they help people and clothes get <a href="/Hygiene" title="Hygiene">clean</a> by lowering the chance of <a href="/Dirt" title="Dirt">dirt</a> and <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a> to get to the skin or <a href="/Fabric" title="Fabric">fabric</a>. Soaps are made from <a href="/Animal" title="Animal">animal</a> <a href="/Fat" title="Fat">fats</a> or <a href="/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">vegetable</a> <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oils</a>. There are two basic steps in making soap. They are called Saponification and Salting-out of soap.</p>
<p>Soap cleans very well in <a href="/Soft_water" title="Soft water">soft water</a>. It is not <a href="/Toxicity" title="Toxicity">toxic</a> to water life. It can be broken down by <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>. However, it is slightly <a href="/Solubility" title="Solubility">soluble</a> in water, so it is not often used in <a href="/Washing_machine" title="Washing machine">washing machines</a>. It does not work well in <a href="/Hard_water" title="Hard water">hard water</a>. It cannot be used in strongly <a href="/Acid" title="Acid">acidic</a> <a href="/Solution" title="Solution">solutions</a>. Hand soaps are only acidic enough to remove unwanted skin oils. For other forms of oil, Dishwashing soap is acidic enough to remove almost all forms of oil without damaging other petrolium products such as Plastic. It does not damage skin either.
Soap are the metallic salts of long chain fatty acids. </p>
<p>Many soap experts say that soap can be made in many ways. Humanity has used soap-like things for at least 4000 <a href="/Year" title="Year">years</a>. The earliest recorded evidence of the making of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BC in Ancient <a href="/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> A recipe for soap having <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>, <a href="/Alkali" title="Alkali">alkali</a> and <a href="/Cinnamomum_aromaticum" title="Cinnamomum aromaticum">cassia</a> oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC. </p>
<p>The <a href="/Ebers_papyrus" title="Ebers papyrus">Ebers papyrus</a> (Egypt, 1550 BC) suggests that <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptians</a> bathed commonly and had animal and vegetable oils with alkaline <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salts</a> to make a soap-like substance. Egyptian <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/document">documents</a> say that a soap-like substance was used in the preparation of <a href="/Wool" title="Wool">wool</a> for <a href="/Weaving" title="Weaving">weaving</a>.</p>
