<p><b>Coordinated Universal Time</b> (UTC) is the <a href="/Standard" title="Standard">standard</a> <a href="/Time_zone" title="Time zone">time system</a> of the <a href="/World" title="World">world</a>. It is the standard by which the world regulates <a href="/Clocks" title="Clocks">clocks</a> and time. It is, within about 1 second, <a href="/Solar_time#Mean_solar_time" title="Solar time">mean solar time</a> at 0° <a href="/Longitude" title="Longitude">longitude</a>. </p>
<p>The standard before was <a href="/Greenwich_Mean_Time" title="Greenwich Mean Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a> (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. In fact, there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Some <a href="/Website" title="Website">websites</a>, like <a href="/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, use UTC because it does not make any <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a> look more important than the others. It offers one time for all the <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">internet</a> (the same time can be used by people all over the world). </p>
<p>Timezones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time. For example, UTC -5 (<a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> east coast) is 5 hours behind UTC. If the time is 07:00 UTC, the local time is 02:00 in <a href="/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> (UTC -5) and 10:00 in <a href="/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> (UTC +3).</p>
<p>07:00 UTC is also written more simply as 0700Z (or 07:00Z).</p>
<p>Note that UTC uses the 24-hour clock.  That means there is no 'AM' or 'PM'.  For example, 4:00PM would be 16:00 or 1600.</p>
