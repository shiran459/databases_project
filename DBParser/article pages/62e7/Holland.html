<p><b>Holland</b> is the name of a region in the western part of the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Holland was a <a href="/County" title="County">county</a> of the <a href="/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and later the leading <a href="/Province" title="Province">province</a> of the <a href="/Republic_of_the_Seven_United_Netherlands" title="Republic of the Seven United Netherlands">Republic of the Seven United Netherlands</a> (1581–1795).</p>
<p>Today, there is no <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a> called "Holland". There are two provinces called "Holland" in the Netherlands: <a href="/North_Holland" title="North Holland">North Holland</a> ({{lang-nl|Noord-Holland}}) and <a href="/South_Holland" title="South Holland">South Holland</a> ({{lang-nl|Zuid-Holland}}). Those provinces were created in 1840. The earlier country and province of Holland used to be bigger, but some parts of that province were given to other provinces during the <a href="/France" title="France">French</a> occupation (1795-1813). For example, <a href="/Willemstad" title="Willemstad">Willemstad</a> became part of <a href="/North_Brabant" title="North Brabant">North Brabant</a>, the islands of <a href="/Vlieland" title="Vlieland">Vlieland</a> and <a href="/Terschelling" title="Terschelling">Terschelling</a> were given to <a href="/Friesland" title="Friesland">Friesland</a>, and the island of <a href="/Urk" title="Urk">Urk</a> to <a href="/Overijssel" title="Overijssel">Overijssel</a>. But for a short time during that period (1806–1810), there <i>was</i> a country called "Holland", the <a href="/Kingdom_of_Holland" title="Kingdom of Holland">Kingdom of Holland</a>, which was in the central and northern Netherlands and <a href="/East_Friesland" title="East Friesland">East Friesland</a> in <a href="/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>.</p>
<p>Many people use the name "Holland" to refer to all of the Netherlands, including the <a href="/Provinces_of_the_Netherlands" title="Provinces of the Netherlands">other ten provinces</a>. That is not correct and is like calling the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, "<a href="/England" title="England">England</a>" or "<a href="/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>". Some <a href="/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch people</a> who do not live in Holland do not like it when people call the entire country Holland. But they don't mind using "Holland" when you mean the <a href="/Netherlands_national_football_team" title="Netherlands national football team">Dutch national football team</a>, which they are used to calling "Holland".</p>
