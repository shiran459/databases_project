<p>{{Nature timeline}}
Many people in history had ideas to explain the universe. Most early <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/model">models</a> had the Earth at the centre of the Universe. Some <a href="/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greeks</a> thought that the Universe has infinite space and has existed forever. They thought it had a set of <a href="/Sphere" title="Sphere">spheres</a> which corresponded to the fixed stars, the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> and various <a href="/Planet" title="Planet">planets</a>. The spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>. </p>
<p>Over the centuries, better observations and better ideas of gravity led to <a href="/Copernicus" title="Copernicus">Copernicus</a>'s <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>-centred model. This was hugely controversial at the time, and was fought long and hard by authorities of the <a href="/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Christian church</a> (see <a href="/Giordano_Bruno" title="Giordano Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> and <a href="/Galileo" title="Galileo">Galileo</a>).</p>
<p>The invention of the <a href="/Telescope" title="Telescope">telescope</a> in the <a href="/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, 1608, was a milestone in astronomy. By the mid-19th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished. The modern optical (uses visible light) telescope is still more advanced. Meanwhile, the <a href="/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Newtonian</a> <a href="/Dynamics" title="Dynamics">dynamics</a> (<a href="/Equation" title="Equation">equations</a>) showed how the <a href="/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> worked. </p>
<p>The improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realise that the Solar System is in a <a href="/Galaxy" title="Galaxy">galaxy</a> made of billions of stars, the <a href="/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>, and that other galaxies exist outside it, as far as we can see. Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their <a href="/Spectral_line" title="Spectral line">spectral lines</a> have led to much of <a href="/Physical_cosmology" title="Physical cosmology">modern cosmology</a>. Discovery of the <a href="/Redshift" title="Redshift">redshift</a> showed that the Universe is expanding (see <a href="/Hubble" title="Hubble">Hubble</a>). </p>


<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Big_Bang">Big Bang</span></h3>
<p>The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the <a href="/Big_bang" title="Big bang">Big Bang</a> theory. The Universe <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/expanded">expanded</a> from a very hot, dense phase called the <a href="/Planck_epoch" title="Planck epoch">Planck epoch</a>, in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated. Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and, more generally, the Big Bang idea. Recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of <a href="/Dark_energy" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a>. Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present methods. This has been named <a href="/Dark_matter" title="Dark matter">dark matter</a>.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, dark matter and energy have not been detected directly (that is why they are called 'dark'). Their existence is <a href="/Inference" title="Inference">inferred</a> by <a href="/Deduction" title="Deduction">deduction</a> from observations which would be difficult to explain otherwise.</p>
<p>Current thinking in cosmology is that the <a href="/Age_of_the_Universe" title="Age of the Universe">age of the Universe</a> is 13.73 (± 0.12) billion years,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> and that the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion <a href="/Light_year" title="Light year">light years</a>, or 8.80 {{E|26}} <a href="/Metre" title="Metre">metres</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ly93"><a href="#_note-ly93" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>According to <a href="/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>, space can get bigger faster than the speed of light, but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light. We cannot see space beyond the limitations of light (or any <a href="/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>).</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Etymology.2C_synonyms_and_meaning">Etymology, synonyms and meaning</span></h2>
<p>The word <i>Universe</i> comes from the <a href="/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a> word <i>Univers</i>, which comes from the <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i>universum</i>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The Latin word was used by <a href="/Cicero" title="Cicero">Cicero</a> and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern <a href="/English_language" title="English language">English</a> word is used. </p>
<p>A different <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interpretation">interpretation</a> (way to interpret) of <i>unvorsum</i> is "everything rotated as one" or "everything rotated by one". This refers to an early Greek model of the Universe. In that model, all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the Earth; according to <a href="/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, the rotation of the outermost sphere was <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/responsible">responsible</a> for the motion and change of everything within. It was natural for the Greeks to assume that the Earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, because careful <a href="/Astronomy" title="Astronomy">astronomical</a> and physical measurements (such as the <a href="/Foucault_pendulum" title="Foucault pendulum">Foucault pendulum</a>) are required to prove otherwise.</p>
<p>The most common term for "Universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from <a href="/Pythagoras" title="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> onwards was <i>το παν</i> (The All), defined as all matter (<i>το ολον</i>) and all space (<i>το κενον</i>).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Broadest_meaning">Broadest meaning</span></h3>
<p>The broadest word meaning of the Universe is found in <i><a href="/De_divisione_naturae" title="De divisione naturae">De divisione naturae</a></i> by the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> <a href="/Philosopher" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="/Johannes_Scotus_Eriugena" title="Johannes Scotus Eriugena">Johannes Scotus Eriugena</a>, who defined it as simply everything: everything that exists and everything that does not exist.</p>
<p>Time is not considered in Eriugena's definition; thus, his definition includes everything that exists, has existed and will exist, as well as everything that does not exist, has never existed and will never exist. This all-embracing definition was not adopted by most later philosophers, but something <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/similar">similar</a> is in <a href="/Quantum_physics" title="Quantum physics">quantum physics</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-path_integral"><a href="#_note-path_integral" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition_as_reality">Definition as reality</span></h3>
<p>{{See also|Reality|Physics}}</p>
<p>Usually the Universe is thought to be everything that exists, has existed, and will exist.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-9"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> This definition says that the Universe is made of two elements: <a href="/Space_(physics)" title="Space (physics)">space</a> and <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a>, together known as <a href="/Space-time" title="Space-time">space-time</a> or the <a href="/Vacuum" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a>; and <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a> and different forms of <a href="/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> and <a href="/Momentum" title="Momentum">momentum</a> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/occupying">occupying</a> <a href="/Space-time" title="Space-time">space-time</a>. The two kinds of elements behave according to <a href="/Physical_law" title="Physical law">physical laws</a>, in which we describe how the elements interact. </p>
<p>A similar definition of the term <i>Universe</i> is everything that exists at a single moment of time, such as the present or the beginning of time, as in the sentence "The Universe was of size 0".</p>
<p>In <a href="/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s book <i>The Physics</i>, Aristotle divided το <i>παν</i> (everything) into three roughly analogous elements: <i>matter</i> (the stuff of which the Universe is made), <i>form</i> (the arrangement of that matter in space) and <i>change</i> (how matter is created, destroyed or altered in its properties, and similarly, how form is altered). <a href="/Physical_law" title="Physical law">Physical laws</a> were the rules governing the properties of matter, form and their changes. Later philosophers such as <a href="/Lucretius" title="Lucretius">Lucretius</a>, <a href="/Averroes" title="Averroes">Averroes</a>, <a href="/Avicenna" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> and <a href="/Baruch_Spinoza" title="Baruch Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a> altered or refined these divisions. For example, Averroes and Spinoza have <i>active</i> principles governing the Universe which act on <i>passive</i> elements.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Space-time_definitions">Space-time definitions</span></h3>
<p>It is possible to form <a href="/Space-time" title="Space-time">space-times</a>, each existing but not able to touch, move, or change (<a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/interact">interact</a> with each other. An easy way to think of this is a group of separate <a href="/Soap_bubble" title="Soap bubble">soap bubbles</a>, in which people living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles. According to one common terminology, each "soap bubble" of space-time is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular <a href="/Space-time" title="Space-time">space-time</a> is denoted as <i>the Universe</i>, just as we call our moon <i>the <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a></i>. The entire collection of these separate space-times is denoted as the <a href="/Multiverse" title="Multiverse">multiverse</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-EllisKS03"><a href="#_note-EllisKS03" title="">[10]</a></sup> In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different <a href="/Dimension" title="Dimension">dimensionalities</a> and <a href="/Topology" title="Topology">topologies</a> of <a href="/Space-time" title="Space-time">space-time</a>, different forms of <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a> and <a href="/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a>, and different <a href="/Physical_law" title="Physical law">physical laws</a> and <a href="/Physical_constant" title="Physical constant">physical constants</a>, although such possibilities are <a href="/Speculation" title="Speculation">speculations</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Observable_reality">Observable reality</span></h3>
<p>According to a still-more-restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected <a href="/Space-time" title="Space-time">space-time</a> that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general idea of relativity</a>, some regions of <a href="/Outer_space" title="Outer space">space</a> may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe, due to the finite <a href="/Speed_of_light" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a> and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe would exist forever; space may expand faster than light can traverse it. </p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are; yet we can never interact with them, even in principle.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the <i>observable universe</i>. </p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space-time than an observer who remains still, so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler may not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the 'observable universe' means the universe seen from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

Thus, a very rough estimate from these numbers would suggest there are around one sextillion (10<sup>21</sup>) stars in the observable universe; though a 2003 study by Australian National University astronomers resulted in a figure of 70 sextillion (7 x 10<sup>22</sup>).<sup class="reference" id="_ref-19"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The matter that can be seen is spread throughout the universe, when averaged over distances longer than 300 million light-years.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-20"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> However, on smaller length-scales, matter is observed to form 'clumps', many <a href="/Atoms" title="Atoms">atoms</a> are condensed into <a href="/Star" title="Star">stars</a>, most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into galaxy groups and clusters and, lastly, the largest-scale structures such as the <a href="/Great_Wall" title="Great Wall">Great Wall</a> of galaxies. </p>
<p>The present overall <a href="/Density" title="Density">density</a> of the Universe is very low, roughly 9.9 × 10<sup>−30</sup> grams per cubic centimetre.

This getting bigger accounts for how Earth-bound people can see the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away, even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded.

<p>{{Main|General relativity|}}</p>
<p>Accurate predictions of the universe's past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation. The best theory available is <a href="/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s general theory of relativity, which has passed all experimental tests so far. However, since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on <i>cosmological</i> length scales, general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate. Nevertheless, its predictions appear to be consistent with observations, so there is no reason to adopt another theory.</p>
<p>General relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric (<a href="/Einstein_field_equations" title="Einstein field equations">Einstein's field equations</a>) that must be solved from the distribution of <a href="/Mass-energy" title="Mass-energy">mass-energy</a> and <a href="/Momentum" title="Momentum">momentum</a> throughout the universe. Since these are unknown in exact detail, cosmological models have been based on the <a href="/Cosmological_principle" title="Cosmological principle">cosmological principle</a>, which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. In effect, this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density. The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein's field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales.</p>

<p>The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above, such as the correlation of distance and <a href="/Redshift" title="Redshift">redshift</a> of galaxies, the universal ratio of hydrogen:helium atoms, and the ubiquitous, isotropic microwave radiation background. As noted above, the redshift arises from the <a href="/Metric_expansion_of_space" title="Metric expansion of space">metric expansion of space</a>; as the space itself expands, the wavelength of a <a href="/Photon" title="Photon">photon</a> traveling through space likewise increases, decreasing its energy. The longer a photon has been traveling, the more expansion it has undergone; hence, older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted. Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental <a href="/Physical_cosmology" title="Physical cosmology">physical cosmology</a>.</p>
<p>Other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with <a href="/Nuclear_physics" title="Nuclear physics">nuclear</a> and <a href="/Atomic_physics" title="Atomic physics">atomic physics</a>. As the universe expands, the energy density of the <a href="/Electromagnetic_radiation" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> decreases more quickly than does that of <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a>, since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. Thus, although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter, it was once dominated by radiation; poetically speaking, all was <a href="/Light" title="Light">light</a>. As the universe expanded, its energy density decreased and it became cooler; as it did so, the <a href="/Elementary_particle" title="Elementary particle">elementary particles</a> of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, in the early part of the matter-dominated era, stable <a href="/Proton" title="Proton">protons</a> and <a href="/Neutron" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> formed, which then associated into <a href="/Atomic_nuclei" title="Atomic nuclei">atomic nuclei</a>. At this stage, the matter in the universe was mainly a hot, dense <a href="/Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> of negative <a href="/Electron" title="Electron">electrons</a>, neutral <a href="/Neutrino" title="Neutrino">neutrinos</a> and positive nuclei. <a href="/Nuclear_reaction" title="Nuclear reaction">Nuclear reactions</a> among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei, particularly <a href="/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="/Deuterium" title="Deuterium">deuterium</a>, and <a href="/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a>. Eventually, the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation; at this point, the radiation decoupled from the matter, forming the ubiquitous, isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today.

<p>Other observations are not clearly answered by known physics. According to the prevailing theory, a slight imbalance of <a href="/Matter" title="Matter">matter</a> over <a href="/Antimatter" title="Antimatter">antimatter</a> was present in the universe's creation, or developed very shortly thereafter. Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another, producing <a href="/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a>, a small residue of matter survived, giving the present matter-dominated universe. </p>
<p>Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid <a href="/Cosmic_inflation" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a> of the universe occurred very early in its history (roughly 10<sup>−35</sup> seconds after its creation). Recent observations also suggest that the <a href="/Cosmological_constant" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant</a> (<i>Λ</i>) is not zero and that the net <a href="/Mass-energy" title="Mass-energy">mass-energy</a> content of the universe is dominated by a <a href="/Dark_energy" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a> and <a href="/Dark_matter" title="Dark matter">dark matter</a> that have not been characterized scientifically. They differ in their gravitational effects. Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does, and thus slows the expansion of the universe; by contrast, dark energy serves to accelerate the universe's expansion.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Multiverse">Multiverse</span></h2>
<p>{{Main|Multiverse}}</p>
<p>Some people think that there is more than one Universe. They think that there is a <a href="/Set_theory" title="Set theory">set</a> of universes called the <a href="/Multiverse" title="Multiverse">multiverse</a>. By definition, there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another.
The multiverse is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it. An idea that cannot be tested is not science.</p>
