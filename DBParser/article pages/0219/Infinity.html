<p><b>Infinity</b> is about things which never end. Sometimes, it is also written <span class="math">\infty</span>. Infinity means many different things, depending on when it is used. The word is from a <a href="/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word, which means "without end". Infinity goes on forever, so sometimes space, numbers, and other things are said to be 'infinite', because they never come to a stop.</p>
<p>Infinity is not really an ordinary number, but it is sometimes used as one. Infinity often says how <i>many</i> there is of something, instead of how <i>big</i> something is. For example, there are infinitely many <a href="/Whole_number" title="Whole number">whole numbers</a> (called <a href="/Integer" title="Integer">integers</a>), but there is no integer which is infinitely big. But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity. So its meaning often changes.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of infinity: <a href="/Potential" title="Potential">potential</a> infinity and <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/actual">actual</a> infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity is a more abstract idea. For example, there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Infinity_in_Mathematics">Infinity in Mathematics</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Mathematicians" title="Mathematicians">Mathematicians</a> have different sizes of infinity and three different kinds of infinity.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ax"><a href="#_note-ax" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Counting_infinity">Counting infinity</span></h3>
<p>The number of things, beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., to include infinite cardinal numbers. There are many different cardinal numbers. Infinity can be defined in one of two ways: Infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size; Infinity is larger than all of the <a href="/Natural_numbers" title="Natural numbers">natural numbers</a>. There is a smallest infinite number, <i>countable infinity</i>. It is the counting number for all of the whole numbers. It is also the counting number of the <a href="/Rational_numbers" title="Rational numbers">rational numbers</a>. The mathematical notation is the Hebrew letter aleph with a subscrpt zero; <span class="math">\aleph_0</span>. It is spoken "aleph null". 
It was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-ax_b"><a href="#_note-ax" title="">[1]</a></sup> The number of <a href="/Real_numbers" title="Real numbers">real numbers</a>, that is all numbers with decimals, is larger than the number of <a href="/Rational_numbers" title="Rational numbers">rational numbers</a>, the number of fractions. This shows that there are real numbers which are not fractions. The smallest infinite number greater than <span class="math">\aleph_0</span> is <span class="math">\aleph_1</span>. 
The number of mathematical <a href="/Functions" title="Functions">functions</a> is the next infinite cardinal number, <span class="math">\aleph_2</span>.
And these numbers go on without end.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ordering_infinity">Ordering infinity</span></h3>
<p>A different <i>type</i> of infinity are the <a href="/Ordinal_numbers" title="Ordinal numbers">ordinal numbers</a>, beginning "first, second, third, ...". The order "first, second, third, ..." and so on to infinity is <i>different</i> from the order <i>ending</i> "..., third, second, first". The difference is important for <a href="/Mathematical_induction" title="Mathematical induction">mathematical induction</a>. The simple <i>first, second, third, ... </i> has the mathematical name: the Greek letter omega with subscript zero: <span class="math">\omega_0</span>. (Or simply omega <span class="math">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \omega</span>.) The infinite series ending "... third, second, first" is <span class="math"> ^*\omega </span>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_real_line_and_complex_plane">The real line and complex plane</span></h3>
<p>The third <i>type</i> of infinity has the symbol <span class="math">\infty</span>. This is treated as addition to the <a href="/Real_numbers" title="Real numbers">real numbers</a> or the <a href="/Complex_numbers" title="Complex numbers">complex numbers</a>. It is the result of division by zero, or to indicate that a <a href="/Series" title="Series">series</a> is increasing (or decreasing) without bound. The series 1, 2, 3, ... increases without upper bound. This is written: the limit is <span class="math">+\infty</span>. In <a href="/Calculus" title="Calculus">calculus</a>, the <a href="/Integral" title="Integral">integral</a> over all real numbers is written: <span class="math"> \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x)\,dx</span></p>

<p>Each kind of infinity has different rules.</p>

<p><span class="math">\aleph_0 + 1 = 1 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 </span> Addition with "alephs" is <a href="/Commutative" title="Commutative">commutative</a>.</p>

<p><span class="math"> x + \infty = \infty = \infty + \infty = \infty \times \infty = 2 ^ \infty </span></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Subtraction.2C_division">Subtraction, division</span></h3>

<p><span class="math"> 1 / \infty = 0</span> Otherwise, division by infinity is not meaningful. Subtraction with infinity is not meaningful.</p>
