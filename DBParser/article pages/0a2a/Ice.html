<p><b>Ice</b> is the <a href="/Common_name" title="Common name">common name</a> for frozen <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a>.  Other liquids, such as <a href="/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> or <a href="/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> or <a href="/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> could be called ice when they <a href="/Freeze" title="Freeze">freeze</a> but they are called 'milk ice', for instance, instead of just 'ice'.  <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">Liquid</a> water becomes <a href="/Solid" title="Solid">solid</a> <b>ice</b> when it is very cold.  The [[freezing point is 0° <a href="/Celsius" title="Celsius">Celsius</a> (32° <a href="/Fahrenheit" title="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a> or 273 <a href="/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">kelvin</a>).</p>
<p>Ice is commonly made in a home <a href="/Refrigerator" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a> or freezer. If water is put in a freezer and left for a while, the water gets very cold and will freeze solid, creating ice. Water can be placed into a <a href="/Copper" title="Copper">copper</a> (or other metal) <a href="/Container" title="Container">container</a> to cause it freeze into ice faster. <a href="/Metal" title="Metal">Metals</a> are good <a href="/Thermal_conductivity" title="Thermal conductivity">conductors of heat</a>, so water can freeze faster than in a <a href="/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> ice <a href="/Tray" title="Tray">tray</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_ice_is_formed">How ice is formed</span></h2>
<p>Unlike other liquids, water expands as it freezes to become ice; so ice <a href="/Float" title="Float">floats</a> on water because ice has less <a href="/Density" title="Density">density</a> than water. This is very unusual - just about every other liquid gets more dense as it cools; water ice, however, is an important exception. Liquid water expands by about 9% as it becomes ice - it takes up more space. This is because the water molecules are actually farther apart instead of being closer together. The molecules in an ice crystal are arranged in a way that makes it less dense than liquid water.</p>
<p>If water in <a href="/Plumbing" title="Plumbing">plumbing</a> freezes, it can burst the <a href="/Pipe_(material)" title="Pipe (material)">water pipe</a>. Water in <a href="/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a> <a href="/Bottle" title="Bottle">bottles</a> can make them explode when it freezes.  Water freezing in rock cracks can expand enough to split hard <a href="/Rock_(geology)" title="Rock (geology)">rocks</a> apart; this is an important geological <a href="/Weathering" title="Weathering">weathering</a> <a href="/Process" title="Process">process</a> that can wear down <a href="/Mountain" title="Mountain">mountains</a> and make rock into <a href="/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="/Material" title="Material">materials</a> are cooled their <a href="/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a> vibrate less and compact together. When most materials reach a temperature called the <a href="/Freezing_point" title="Freezing point">freezing point</a>, the molecules form a <a href="/Crystal" title="Crystal">crystalline</a> solid - although some materials (like <a href="/Glass" title="Glass">glass</a> and <a href="/Tar" title="Tar">tar</a>) do not crystallise at all but form <a href="/Super_stiff_fluid" title="Super stiff fluid">super stiff fluids</a>, which seem to be solid. Only <a href="/Helium" title="Helium">Helium</a> will not freeze; all other substances will freeze if cold enough, but fluids like <a href="/Cooking_oil" title="Cooking oil">cooking oil</a>, anti-freeze, <a href="/Petrol" title="Petrol">petrol</a> (<a href="/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>), <a href="/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, etc. freeze at temperatures that most people don't experience.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Salt_water">Salt water</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Salt_water" title="Salt water">Salt water</a> needs a lower temperature to freeze than pure water. The resulting ice contains much less <a href="/Salt" title="Salt">salt</a> than the salt water it came from. This fact has sometimes been used for <a href="/Desalination" title="Desalination">desalination</a>. Salty ice is not as strong as frozen pure water.  Similarly spreading salt on ice melts it, if it's not too cold: the salt progressively eats into the ice, forming <a href="/Brine" title="Brine">brine</a> which does not freeze at that temperature.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geographical_locations_of_ice">Geographical locations of ice</span></h2>
<p>Because ice floats, even large bodies of water that freeze, like some <a href="/Ocean" title="Ocean">oceans</a>, only form ice on the surface. Most lakes never freeze to the <a href="/Bottom" title="Bottom">bottom</a>. Even the coldest oceans, like the <a href="/Arctic_Ocean" title="Arctic Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>, only freeze on the top, leaving liquid ocean circulating below. Because of this the Earth's oceans are able to redistribute heat and the <a href="/Climate" title="Climate">climate</a> of the earth has less extremes of heat and cold than it would otherwise. If ice were to sink instead of float, the oceans would fill up with ice from the bottom, would remain solid and only some of the top would thaw. A solid ocean would not circulate heat. But because ice floats on the <a href="/Surface" title="Surface">surface</a> the water beneath can continue to circulate and the ice on the surface stays exposed and readily melts when the temperature rises. <a href="/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> has the majority of the world's ice.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ice_ages">Ice ages</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Climate_change" title="Climate change">Climate change</a> happens all the time.  When it is very cold it is called an <a href="/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice age</a>.  During ice ages very large areas of the earth are covered in ice, <a href="/Snow" title="Snow">snow</a> and <a href="/Glaciers" title="Glaciers">glaciers</a>. The <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cause">causes</a> of ice ages are <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complex">complex</a>, or hard to understand. <a href="/Global_warming" title="Global warming">Global warming</a> is currently affecting the Earth's ice <a href="/Natural_resource" title="Natural resource">resources</a> and its causes are also very complex.</p>

<p>
There is also 'dry ice'; it is frozen <a href="/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. Dry ice exposed to normal air gives off carbon dioxide gas that is odorless and colorless. The gas is so cold that when it mixes with air it cools the <a href="/Water_vapour" title="Water vapour">water vapour</a> in the air to <a href="/Fog" title="Fog">fog</a>, which looks like a thick white <a href="/Smoke" title="Smoke">smoke</a>.
