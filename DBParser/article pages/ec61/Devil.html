In some <a href="/Religion" title="Religion">religions</a>, the <b>devil</b> is a bad <a href="/Spirit" title="Spirit">spirit</a> that tries to create problems for people. Some people also use the words "the Devil" or "<a href="/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a>" for the most powerful devil. The word "devil" comes from the Greek word "diabolos" which means "someone who tells lies to hurt you". ("Diabolos" is translated to the English word "<a href="/Slander" title="Slander">slanderer</a>.") The <a href="/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> uses "diabolos" as a title for <a href="/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a>, and so "The Devil" became another name for Satan in English.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, there is the <a href="/Serpent" title="Serpent">serpent</a> and the <b>shaitan</b>, who may be two different characters. "Shaitan" in <a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> means "adversary", an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the <a href="/Koran" title="Koran">Koran</a>, who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> the Devil was originally an <a href="/Angel" title="Angel">angel</a> in <a href="/Heaven" title="Heaven">heaven</a> called Lucifer. But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God. After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven. Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out.</p>
<p>After the Devil was thrown out of heaven, he started doing bad things on the earth. He wants people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Book_of_Revelation" title="Book of Revelation">Book of Revelation</a> says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in <a href="/Hell" title="Hell">Hell</a>. This will happen in the future.</p>
<p>Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. But nobody knows what he may look like.
