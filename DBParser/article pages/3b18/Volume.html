The <b>volume</b> of an object is a measure of the amount of <a href="/Space_(physics)" title="Space (physics)">space</a> occupied by that object, not to be confused with <a href="/Mass" title="Mass">mass</a>. The volume of a mountain is much larger than the volume of a rock, for instance.</p>
<p>The word volume implies a <a href="/3-D" title="3-D">three-dimensional</a> context where, by convention,
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="/Length" title="Length">length</a> is the longest distance between the object's extremities</li>
<li>the <a href="/Width" title="Width">width</a> (or breadth) refers to the size of the object in a direction perpendicular to its length</li>
<li>the <a href="/Height" title="Height">height</a> (or <a href="/Depth" title="Depth">depth</a>) stands for the size of that object in the direction perpendicular to both the length and the width.</li>
</ul>

<p>For objects at or near the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s surface, height or depth often refers to the dimension of the object along the local vertical. All physical objects occupy a volume, even if some are so thin that they appear to be <a href="/2D" title="2D">two-dimensional</a>, like a sheet of paper.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Units_of_volume">Units of volume</span></h2>
<p>The unit of volume in the <a href="/International_System_of_Units" title="International System of Units">International System of Units</a> is the cubic meter, which is represented by the symbol m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In some fields or applications, it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings. For instance,</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyday quantities of <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a> are often measured in units of a <a href="/Litre" title="Litre">litre</a>, symbol l, which is the volume occupied by a cubic decimetre.</li>
<li>Large quantities of liquids, such as <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>, and sometimes other materials, may be measured and traded in units of <a href="/Barrel" title="Barrel">barrels</a>. There are many different reference volumes called barrels, depending on the nature of the content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries: <a href="/Imperial_unit" title="Imperial unit">Imperial units</a> such as the <a href="/Gallon" title="Gallon">gallon</a> or the <a href="/Fluid_ounce" title="Fluid ounce">fluid ounce</a> were in widespread use within the British Empire. Some of them are still popular in the United States, which also uses units like the <a href="/Bushel" title="Bushel">bushel</a>, or the <a href="/Quart" title="Quart">quart</a>, the cup and the teaspoon (in cooking recipes, for example). See <a href="/U.S._customary_units" title="U.S. customary units">U.S. customary units</a> for more examples.</p>

<p>The volume of an object is not a fundamental property of that object: it can change with environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature, especially if the object is highly compressible.</p>
<p>The volume of a mixture of <a href="/Fluid" title="Fluid">fluids</a> (liquids, <a href="/Gas" title="Gas">gases</a>) may or may not be equal to the sum of their volumes before they were mixed.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Measuring_a_volume">Measuring a volume</span></h2>
<p>The volume of simple geometric objects can often be calculated on the basis of their known dimensions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The volume of a perfect cube of side <i>c</i> is <i>c</i><sup>3</sup></li>
<li>The volume of a parallelepiped of sides <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> is <i>a</i> × <i>b</i> × <i>c</i></li>
<li>The volume of a sphere of radius <i>r</i> is (4/3) π <i>r</i><sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The volume of a gas is typically that of its container, but it could be ill-defined, as in the case of the atmosphere, which has no clear upper limit. The volume of a liquid is often measured by pouring it into a graduated container. The volume of a small <a href="/Solid" title="Solid">solid</a> can be estimated by immersing it into a graduated container partially filled with a known amount of liquid, provided the solid is not soluble in the liquid.</p>
