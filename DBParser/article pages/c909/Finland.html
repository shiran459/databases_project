<p>The people of Finland are called Finns.  Most Finns speak <a href="/Finnish_language" title="Finnish language">Finnish</a> as their mother tongue.  About six percent of Finns have the <a href="/Swedish_language" title="Swedish language">Swedish language</a> as their mother tongue.  They live mostly in the western part of Finland and on <a href="/%C3%85land" title="Åland">Åland</a> (Finnish Ahvenanmaa)</p>
<p>Finns also study mandatory English and Swedish in school. Most Finns work either in services (that is: shops, banks, offices or businesses) or in factories. Finns often like <a href="/Sauna" title="Sauna">saunas</a> and <a href="/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a>. Many Finnish families have <a href="/Summer_cottage" title="Summer cottage">summer cottages</a>, small houses where they go to relax on their summer holidays.

<p>There is a group of a few thousand <a href="/Sami_people" title="Sami people">Samis</a> (also called Lapps) in the most northern part of Finland, called <a href="/Lapland" title="Lapland">Lapland</a>. Most of the Samis live in <a href="/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. Many Sami people farm <a href="/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">reindeers</a>.

<p>
Most of Finland is covered by pine <a href="/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a>. The <a href="/Swan" title="Swan">swan</a>, which was considered holy long ago, is the national bird of Finland. Wood is the most important natural resource of Finland. It is estimated that up to one-third of all wood resources of the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> are in Finland.</p>
<p>The national animal of Finland is the <a href="/Brown_bear" title="Brown bear">brown bear</a>. The largest animal is the <a href="/Elk" title="Elk">elk</a>, a type of moose, which is a member of the deer family.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of rivers and thousands of fresh water lakes. <a href="/Fishing" title="Fishing">Fishing</a> is a popular <a href="/Sport" title="Sport">sport</a>. It is estimated there are almost 180,000 lakes in Finland.</p>
<p>Many islands in the <a href="/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> belong to Finland, too. Thousands of islands are part of the <a href="/%C3%85land" title="Åland">Åland</a> <a href="/Archipelago" title="Archipelago">archipelago</a>. Tourists from all over the world come to see the fells and the <a href="/Aurora" title="Aurora">northern lights</a> in <a href="/Lapland" title="Lapland">Lapland</a>.</p>
<p>The highest mountain of Finland is Halti, which is 1328 meters high. The largest lake is Saimaa, 4,400 square kilometres. The longest river of Finland is Tornionjoki. The largest river (by watershed) is Kemijoki, 552 kilometres long.</p>
<p>The weather in Finland varies widely by season.  Summer usually lasts from May to early September, and temperatures can reach up to +35 °C.  Autumns are dark and rainy. Winter snow usually begins to fall in Helsinki in early December (in Lapland it can fall as early as October) and in the winter the temperature can drop to -30 °C.  Winter usually lasts to mid-March, when the snow melts in Helsinki (in Lapland the snow usually doesn't melt until early May), and Spring lasts till late May. Spring can be erratic, and the weather can change from frost to sunshine within a matter of days. The famed <a href="/Aurora" title="Aurora">Northern Lights</a> are common in Lapland.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_Finland">History of Finland</span></h2>
<p>People first came to Finland 10,000 years ago. That was just after an <a href="/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice age</a>, after a glacier that covered the ground had receded.</p>
<p>Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language similar to the <a href="/Finnish_language" title="Finnish language">Finnish language</a> that is spoken today. It is known that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the <a href="/Iron_Age" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>. (The Iron Age in Finland was 2,500–800 years ago).</p>
<p>The first residents in Finland hunted animals, as "<a href="/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a>".  Some people started to <a href="/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">farm</a> crops about 5,200 years ago. Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age. </p>


<p>The ancient Finns were <a href="/Paganism" title="Paganism">pagans</a>. The most important god of the Finnish pantheon was <a href="/Ukko" title="Ukko">Ukko</a>. He was a god of <a href="/Sky" title="Sky">sky</a> and <a href="/Thunder" title="Thunder">thunder</a>, much like <a href="/Odin" title="Odin">Odin</a>, another Scandinavian god-king. These powers were common among the pagan god kings in pantheons ranging from the Finnish Ukko, to the Scandinavian/Germanic/Saxon <a href="/Odin" title="Odin">Odin</a>, all the way east to <a href="/Zeus" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> of the Greeks and Jupiter of the Romans. </p>
<p>Around a thousand years ago, when most of Europe was adopting Christianity, Finland also began following Christianity.  During the <a href="/Reformation" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> of Christianity in the 16th century, most Finns became <a href="/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestants</a>. Some pagan practices still remain amongst the now Christian Finns, such as <a href="/Bear_worship" title="Bear worship">bear worship</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> Finland was a part of <a href="/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. Then, in the year <a href="/1809" title="1809">1809</a>, <a href="/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> took Finland from Sweden. Finland was a part of Russia, but after a short period of time it became <a href="/Autonomy" title="Autonomy">autonomous</a>. The Finns essentially controlled Finland, though the Tsar was in control officially. Finns could create their own laws and had their own currency, (called the <i><a href="/Markka" title="Markka">markka</a></i>), their own <a href="/Stamp" title="Stamp">stamps</a> and own <a href="/Custom" title="Custom">customs</a>. However, Finland did not have its own <a href="/Army" title="Army">army</a>.</p>


<p> 
On 6 December 1917, Finland became independent, which meant that it no longer was a part of Russia. There was a <a href="/October_Revolution" title="October Revolution">communist revolution</a> in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the <a href="/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. There were <a href="/Communism" title="Communism">communists</a> in Finland too, who tried to create a revolution in Finland. This attempt at revolution caused the <a href="/Finnish_civil_war" title="Finnish civil war">Finnish civil war</a>. The communists lost the civil war, and Finland did not change its old capitalist system.</p>
<p><a href="/Stalin" title="Stalin">Stalin</a>, who was the leader of the Soviet Union, did not like having a <a href="/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> country as its neighbour. Stalin wanted Finland to become a <a href="/Communism" title="Communism">communist</a> state and be a part of the Soviet Union. The leaders of Finland refused: they wanted to stay independent. The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them, which resulted in the <a href="/Winter_War" title="Winter War">Winter War</a>. There were many battles, that eventually resulted in Finland losing areas along its eastern border to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p><a href="/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was the dictator of Germany, and he wanted to invade the Soviet Union. Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost, so they joined the German invasion, which started in 1941. This part of the <a href="/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> is called the <a href="/Continuation_War" title="Continuation War">Continuation War</a> in Finland. However, Finland was not a <a href="/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascist</a> or an <a href="/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a> country. Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship.</p>
<p>While Germany was losing the war, Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace. Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union, which resulted in peace. Once again Finland had to give up the areas they had conquered. This time, the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies. Finns fought the Germans, and Germans retreated to <a href="/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>, burning down all of Lapland behind them. This is called the <a href="/Lapland_War" title="Lapland War">Lapland War</a>.  Finland remained independent.</p>
<p>After the war, many factories were built in Finland. Many people moved from farms to cities. At that time, big factories manufactured products like <a href="/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a> and <a href="/Steel" title="Steel">steel</a>. More and more people worked in more advanced jobs, like <a href="/High_technology" title="High technology">high technology</a>. Also, many people went to universities to get a good education. Finland was one of the first countries where most people had <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> connections and mobile phones. A well-known company that makes <a href="/Mobile_phone" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>, <a href="/Nokia" title="Nokia">Nokia</a>, is from Finland.</p>
<p>Finland joined the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> in 1995. The Finnish currency was changed to the <a href="/Euro" title="Euro">euro</a> in 2002.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
<p>Finland has a mixed economy. <a href="/Free_market" title="Free market">Free market</a> controls most of production and sales of goods, but public sector is involved in services. In 2013, taxes were 44% of gross national product. This is 4th largest in Europe, after Denmark, France and Belgium.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 2014 services were 70% of the gross national product.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The largest company in 2014 was oil refinery <a href="/Neste_Oil" title="Neste Oil">Neste Oil</a>. The second largest was <a href="/Nokia" title="Nokia">Nokia</a>. Two forest industries <a href="/Stora_Enso" title="Stora Enso">Stora Enso</a> and <a href="/UPM-Kymmene" title="UPM-Kymmene">UPM-Kymmene</a>, were numbers three and four.
