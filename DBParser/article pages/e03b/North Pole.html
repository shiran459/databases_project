The <b>North Pole</b> is the point that is farthest north on the planet Earth. It is the point on which axis of <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> turns. It is in the <a href="/Arctic_Ocean" title="Arctic Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> and it's cold there because the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high. The <a href="/Arctic_Ocean" title="Arctic Ocean">ocean</a> around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of <a href="/Ice" title="Ice">ice</a>. </p>
<p>There is also a <a href="/Magnetic_North_Pole" title="Magnetic North Pole">Magnetic North Pole</a>. It is near the physical North Pole. A <a href="/Compass" title="Compass">compass</a> points toward the magnetic North Pole.</p>
<p>There is a star, called the North Star or <a href="/Polaris_(star)" title="Polaris (star)">Polaris</a>, that is always in the sky above the North Pole. People can tell how far north they are by seeing how high the North Star appears in the sky.</p>
