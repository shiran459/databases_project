The hunt for Jews in eastern Romania (including Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transnistria and the city of Iasi) had more the character of pogroms than the German, well-organized camps and transport.</p>
<p>There where pogroms in the city of Iasi. The homes for the Jewish minority in Iasi were marked with crosses. On June 27, 1941, Ion Antonescu make a phone call with the city's mayor and Antonescu said into the phone: "clean the city <a href="/Iasi" title="Iasi">Iasi</a> from the Jews." And the Holocaust in Romania has began. Police officers and many civilians went to every Jewish home marked with a cross in the town and murdered thousands of Jews on the same day.</p>
<p>In June 1941, the Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu gave an "illegal secret order" to the special police force. He ordered the police in cooperation with the Romanian Army and the German SS troops to kill all Jews in east Romania within the next coming years. The Jews living on the countryside was being killed right on the spot. The Jews in the cities were first collected in the ghettos and later deported away.</p>
<p>On October 22, 1941 the Soviet union with bombs blow up the Romanian military headquarters in Odessa, and killed 66 Romanian soldiers. As revenge Ion Antonescu decided that for every dead Romanian officer, 200 Soviet communists must be killed and for each dead soldier, 100 communists must be killed. All other Communists were imprisoned and Jewish families were taken hostage in the hope that the partisan movement would cease its operations.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-levandehistoria.se"><a href="#_note-levandehistoria.se" title="">[56]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-romania.bloggsida.se"><a href="#_note-romania.bloggsida.se" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>

<p>Romania joined the <a href="/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> on January 1, 2007. Romania's <a href="/Economy" title="Economy">economy</a> is healthy.

<p>Long into the 1900s, Romania was still a largely agricultural country. During Communism 1947-1989, the country had planned economy. The transition from planned economy to a market economy after the communist regime led to economic collapse in the 1990s, the reasons was that more money was printed, expensive prices and substantial privatization of the companies, which initially leads to skyrocketing unemployment. The reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign investors for the first time to buy land in Romania. When it was going explosively good for the industry in the Latin countries such as <a href="/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, these countries began to trade with Romania because it is favorite voice country for them to grow in.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Education">Education</span></h2>
<p>The Romanian school is obligatory for 10 years. Children also have the opportunity to be part of a voluntary pre-school at an early age 3–6 years. After school, students can voluntarily take the entrance exam to high school, which has a range of practical and theoretical lines. There are over 40 higher educational institutions, including five universities and five technical colleges. Tuition is free and is a hot political commitment even at the university. The country's minorities have the opportunity to receive instruction in their native language. Since 1989, education has been reformed. But it has been slow and the standard of education varies greatly in different parts of the country, education has improved the standard of urban compared to rural areas where quality can be very low. Romania participates fully in the EU's education program.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-84"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_welfare">Social welfare</span></h2>

<p>The living standards were very low at the end of the Communist era, but the situation was just only improved a little bit during the 1990s. On the contrary, the living significantly due caused by the large privatization of jobs that resulted in high unemployment and rising prices. In later years lived yet 2010 nearly 10 percent of the population in absolute poverty<sup class="reference" id="_ref-86"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> and of these, 90% live in rural areas. The State social insurance system have relatively broad coverage but resources are extremely small.</p>
<p>Reforms have been initiated and in 1999 the health insurance became privatized and paid by the employers and the employees. Several thousand local trade unions were founded after the revolution, which were later amalgamated (combined) into federations. These unions and federations have helped organise students, pensioners and the unemployed; because these groups of people all have similar needs, concerns and goals.</p>
<p>By the first quarter of 2011 the average monthly household income is 2,318 <a href="/Romanian_leu" title="Romanian leu">Romanian leu</a> (equivalent to approximately £862 USD).

<p>The most worrying thing is the fact that there are more pensioners than the number of working people. because many who dismissed during the privatizations had per-retirement. Romanian Pensioners average pension at the month is at about 190 euros (equivalent to approximately £250-300 USD). The current low average retirement age (55 years for men and 57 years for women) will be gradually increased until 2014, when it gets 60 years for women and 65 years for men.</p>
<p>Many of the country's Gypsies have no identity cards and are therefore excluded from the social benefit systems, schools and health care. The State-run health care is free, but the care system is neglected and has deteriorated in recent years due to lack of resources and underpaid staff. In many cases,the patients paying "under the table" to get treatment. here is evidence to suggest that a patient's wealth plays an important role in how they receive medical treatment.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-91"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
