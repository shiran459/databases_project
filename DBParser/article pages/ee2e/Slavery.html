<p>In one form or another slavery has been practiced since the earliest civilizations.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-8"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Early <a href="/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> had no use for slaves.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-HistWld"><a href="#_note-HistWld" title="">[9]</a></sup> They did everything for themselves.

Slavery or owning another person made no sense to these people.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-HistWld_b"><a href="#_note-HistWld" title="">[9]</a></sup> Once men gathered in <a href="/Cities" title="Cities">cities</a> and <a href="/Towns" title="Towns">towns</a> and there was more than enough food, having a cheap supply of labor made sense.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-HistWld_c"><a href="#_note-HistWld" title="">[9]</a></sup> This is when the earliest forms of slavery appeared. Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records, such as the <i><a href="/Code_of_Hammurabi" title="Code of Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a></i> (c. 1760 BC). This refers to it as an established institution.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-10"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Ancient Near East, captives obtained through warfare often became slaves. This was seen by the <a href="/Law" title="Law">laws</a> in the <a href="/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> book of  <a href="/Deuteronomy" title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> as a legal form of slavery. But the <a href="/Israelites" title="Israelites">Israelites</a> were not allowed to enslave other Israelites. The Deuteronomic Code calls for the <a href="/Death_penalty" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a> for the <a href="/Crime" title="Crime">crime</a> of <a href="/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a> Israelites to enslave them.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, slaves were mainly prisoners of war. Other ways people could become slaves was by <a href="/Inheritance" title="Inheritance">inheriting</a> the status from their parents who were slaves. Someone could become a slave if he could not pay his <a href="/Debt" title="Debt">debts</a>. People also sold themselves into slavery because they were poor <a href="/Peasant" title="Peasant">peasants</a> and needed <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a> and <a href="/Shelter" title="Shelter">shelter</a>. The lives of slaves were normally better than that of peasants.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-touregypt1"><a href="#_note-touregypt1" title="">[11]</a></sup> Young slaves could not be put to hard work, and had to be brought up by the mistress of the <a href="/Household" title="Household">household</a>. Not all slaves went to houses. Some also sold themselves to <a href="/Temple" title="Temple">temples</a>, or were assigned to temples by the <a href="/King" title="King">king</a>. Slave trading was not very popular until later in Ancient Egypt. Afterwards, slave trades sprang up all over Egypt.</p>

<p>Roman slaves played an important <a href="/Role" title="Role">role</a> in <a href="/Society" title="Society">society</a> and the economy. Besides manual labor, slaves performed many <a href="/Domestic_worker" title="Domestic worker">domestic services</a>. They could work at highly skilled jobs and <a href="/Profession" title="Profession">professions</a>. <a href="/Teacher" title="Teacher">Teachers</a>, <a href="/Accountant" title="Accountant">accountants</a>, and <a href="/Physician" title="Physician">physicians</a> were often slaves. <a href="/Greece" title="Greece">Greek</a> slaves were often <a href="/Education" title="Education">highly educated</a>. Unskilled slaves, or those sentenced to slavery as <a href="/Punishment" title="Punishment">punishment</a>, worked on <a href="/Farm" title="Farm">farms</a>, in <a href="/Mining" title="Mining">mines</a>, and at <a href="/Mill_(grinding)" title="Mill (grinding)">mills</a>. Their living conditions were brutal, and their lives short.</p>
<p>Slaves were considered property under <a href="/Roman_law" title="Roman law">Roman law</a> and had no legal personhood. Unlike <a href="/Roman_citizen" title="Roman citizen">Roman citizens</a>, they could be subjected to corporal punishment, <a href="/Sexual_abuse" title="Sexual abuse">sexual exploitation</a> (<a href="/Prostitute" title="Prostitute">prostitutes</a> were often slaves), <a href="/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a>, and <a href="/Execution" title="Execution">summary execution</a>. The testimony of a slave could not be accepted in a court of law unless the slave was tortured—a practice based on the belief that slaves in a position to be privy to their masters' affairs would be too virtuously loyal to reveal damaging evidence unless coerced. Over time, however, slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. Attitudes changed in part because of the influence among the educated elite of the <a href="/Stoicism" title="Stoicism">Stoics</a>, whose <a href="/Egalitarianism" title="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> views of humanity extended to slaves.</p>
<p>Roman slaves could hold <a href="/Property" title="Property">property</a> which, even though it belonged to their <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/master">masters</a>, they were allowed to use as if it were their own.

Historians estimate that between 650 <a href="/AD" title="AD">AD</a> and the 1960s, 10 to 18 million people were enslaved by Arab slave traders. They were taken from Europe, Asia and Africa across the <a href="/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>, <a href="/Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, and <a href="/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> desert.

Most male slaves were <a href="/Castration" title="Castration">castrated</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-MooreABS"><a href="#_note-MooreABS" title="">[13]</a></sup> It is estimated that as many as 6 out of every 10 boys <a href="/Bleeding" title="Bleeding">bled</a> to death during the process.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-MooreABS_b"><a href="#_note-MooreABS" title="">[13]</a></sup> But the high price of <a href="/Eunuch" title="Eunuch">Eunuchs</a> made it worthwhile. Woman and children taken as slaves were mainly used as servants and <a href="/Concubinage" title="Concubinage">concubines</a>. While the later Atlantic slave trade concentrated on men for labor, the Arab slave trade started with men and boys, but shifted over time to concentrate more on woman and young girls for <a href="/Sex" title="Sex">sexual</a> purposes.</p>

But the mines and fields of the colonies needed more and more slaves. In the early 16th century Spain began to issue <a href="/License" title="License">licenses</a> and <a href="/Contract" title="Contract">contracts</a> to suply slaves.

The earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in 1640. This is where a negro, <a href="/John_Punch_(slave)" title="John Punch (slave)">John Punch</a>, was sentenced to lifetime slavery for attempting to run away.
