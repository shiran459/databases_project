<p>The internet is used for many things, such as <a href="/Electronic_mail" title="Electronic mail">electronic mail</a>, <a href="/Online_chat" title="Online chat">online chat</a>, <a href="/Computer_file" title="Computer file">file</a> transfer, and the interlinked <a href="/Web_page" title="Web page">web pages</a> and other documents of the <a href="/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
<p>The most used service on the internet is the <a href="/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> (which is also called the "Web"). The Web contains <a href="/Website" title="Website">websites</a>, including <a href="/Blog" title="Blog">blogs</a> and <a href="/Wiki" title="Wiki">wikis</a> like <a href="/Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. <a href="/Webpage" title="Webpage">Webpages</a> on the internet can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a <a href="/Password" title="Password">password</a>, or it is blocked).</p>
<p>The second biggest use of the internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/user">user</a> to another. <a href="/Instant_messaging" title="Instant messaging">Instant messaging</a> (such as <a href="/AIM" title="AIM">AIM</a> or <a href="/ICQ" title="ICQ">ICQ</a>) is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other much faster.</p>
<p>Some governments think the Internet is a bad thing, and block all or part of it.  For example, the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad. Many times no one in <a href="/China" title="China">China</a> can read it or add to it.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Some <a href="/Parent" title="Parent">parents</a> block parts of the internet they think are bad for <a href="/Child" title="Child">children</a> to see. Well-known examples of the whole internet being blocked are in <a href="/North_Korea" title="North Korea">North Korea</a><sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and <a href="/Myanmar" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>.</p>

<p>The internet can also be dangerous. People sometimes use it to spread lies or other people's secrets or dangerously bad advice. When someone sends information through the internet, sometimes other people can read it even when they are not supposed to. For example, <a href="/Facebook" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> has had some problems with <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/privacy">privacy</a> settings.  A person can post information on a website, but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure of what they are doing.  One way to check for a secure website is to make sure the <a href="/URL" title="URL">URL</a> starts with https:// instead of http://.  This means it is secured so other people cannot read information while it is being sent.  However, it does not mean the website will do things to keep it safe.
