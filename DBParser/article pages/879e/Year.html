One <b>year</b> is about 365 <a href="/Day" title="Day">days</a> long (except in a <a href="/Leap_year" title="Leap year">leap year</a>). It is the time it takes the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> to go completely around (<a href="/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbit</a>) the <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">sun</a> once. A year is actually 365Â¼ days long, but a <a href="/Calendar" title="Calendar">calendar</a> has 365 days, except in a leap year.</p>
<p>The year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the <a href="/Gregorian_calendar" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, but a <a href="/Fiscal_year" title="Fiscal year">fiscal year</a> or a <a href="/School_year" title="School year">school year</a> can start on a different day of the year.</p>
<p>There are several ways used to measure the length of a year.</p>

<ul>
<li>a <b>solar</b> year is based on the <a href="/Season" title="Season">seasons</a>. The Gregorian calendar is based on the solar year.  The solar year is 365 days long.</li>
<li>a <b>lunar</b> year is based on the <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">moon</a> and is usually 12 <a href="/Lunar_month" title="Lunar month">lunar months</a> (29 days, 12 <a href="/Hour" title="Hour">hours</a>, 44 <a href="/Minute" title="Minute">minutes</a> each) or 354 days long.</li>
<li>a <b>tropical</b> year is the time between two <a href="/Equinox" title="Equinox">vernal equinoxes</a>, the first day of spring when the lengths of daylight and night are the same.</li>
<li>a <b>sidereal</b> year measures the time between when a selected <a href="/Star" title="Star">fixed star</a> is highest in the <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/night">night</a> <a href="/Sky" title="Sky">sky</a>.</li>
<li>an <b>anomalistic year</b> is the difference between the times when the Earth gets closest to the sun.</li>
<li>an <b>eclipse</b> year is the time between node passages. This is when the sun moves through a part of the sky where it is possible for the sun, Earth and moon to be in a line. It is also when <a href="/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipses</a> can happen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solar and lunar years are used by different <a href="/Society" title="Society">societies</a> in daily life. The other measurements are used by <a href="/Astronomer" title="Astronomer">astronomers</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>there was no year numbered "year zero" in a normal system of counting, because it would mean there is a year earlier than the first year, which was the year <a href="/1" title="1">AD one</a> in the <a href="/Anno_Domini" title="Anno Domini">Anno Domini</a> system, also called 1 CE in the <a href="/Common_Era" title="Common Era">Common Era</a>, used with our <a href="/Gregorian_calendar" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>. However, some astronomers call the year 1 BC (or BCE) "year 0" to make it easier for them to count leap years before that year. </li>
</ul>
