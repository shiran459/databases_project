<b>Ebola virus</b> is a very dangerous <a href="/Virus" title="Virus">virus</a>. It belongs to the Filoviridae family and is responsible for a severe disease characterized by the sudden onset of hemorrhagic fever accompanied by other nonspecific signs and symptoms.  "Hemorrhagic" means that the victim will bleed a lot, inside and outside their body. The virus attacks almost every organ and tissue of the human body resulting in multi-organ dysfunction. Out of every 10 people who get Ebola, on average five to nine die. There are four kinds of Ebola virus that can cause the disease. The virus was first found in <a href="/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>. It is found in <a href="/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, with very few cases in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

The Ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the <a href="/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> and other liquids and wet things in some kinds of non-human animals without killing them. Scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or <a href="/Fruit_bat" title="Fruit bat">fruit bats</a>. When people touch animals that have the virus, or wet things that came out of those animals, they can get sick.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-WHO2014"><a href="#_note-WHO2014" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Ebola cannot be caught through the air, or by being near sick people.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-WHOAir2014"><a href="#_note-WHOAir2014" title="">[3]</a></sup> The virus can only go from <a href="/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquids</a> into people's bodies. This means Ebola can be caught by touching a sick person's <a href="/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a>, <a href="/Saliva" title="Saliva">saliva</a>, <a href="/Mucus" title="Mucus">mucus</a>, <a href="/Semen" title="Semen">semen</a>, <a href="/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, <a href="/Vomit" title="Vomit">vomit</a>, or other fluids that come out of a sick person's body.</p>
<p>If a person does not die from the disease, he can still give other people the infection by having <a href="/Sex" title="Sex">sex</a> for nearly another two months after they stop being sick. This is because the virus can still be in the man's <a href="/Semen" title="Semen">semen</a> after a long time.</p>
<p>1. Once the virus enters the human body via mucosal surfaces, abrasions or injuries in the skin or by direct parental transmission, it fuses with the cells lining the respiratory tract, eyes, or body cavities.</p>
<p>2. It invades the macrophages and dendritic immune cells and releases its genetic content. The cell explosion triggers the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines initiating a ‘cytokine storm’. The genetic material takes over the cell machinery to replicate itself; new copies of the virus are formed and released into the system.</p>
<p>3. The virus then, goes on to attack spleen, kidneys and even the brain. The blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the surrounding tissues. This atypical clotting and bleeding at the same time manifests externally in the form of rashes.</p>
<p>4. The virus causes the shutdown of other vital organs such as liver and lungs too. In fact, it is able to invade almost all human cells through different attachment mechanisms for each cell type (except for lymphocytes). The very cells that are meant to fight infection are used as carriers to spread infection to other body parts</p>
<p>5. It has been found that the ebola-infected cells do not undergo normal apoptosis, but exhibit vacuolization and signs of necrosis.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Symptoms">Symptoms</span></h2>
<p>When people get Ebola the first <a href="/Symptom" title="Symptom">symptoms</a> look like some other diseases. People get a <a href="/Fever" title="Fever">fever</a> and feel very tired. Their <a href="/Headache" title="Headache">head</a>, <a href="/Stomach" title="Stomach">stomach</a>, <a href="/Joint" title="Joint">joints</a>, and <a href="/Throat" title="Throat">throat</a> might hurt. Sometimes, people think they have other diseases like <a href="/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a> or <a href="/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a>.</p>
<p>Later, people get much sicker. They bleed both inside and outside their bodies. They have <a href="/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> in their <a href="/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a> and <a href="/Vomit" title="Vomit">vomit</a>. They bleed from their <a href="/Nose" title="Nose">noses</a>, <a href="/Mouth" title="Mouth">mouths</a>, and <a href="/Genital" title="Genital">genitals</a>/sex organs. They get <a href="/Shock_(circulatory)" title="Shock (circulatory)">shock</a>: low <a href="/Blood_pressure" title="Blood pressure">blood pressure</a>, fast pulse (<a href="/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> rate), and low <a href="/Circulatory_system" title="Circulatory system">blood circulation</a> to the body. Their <a href="/Organ_(anatomy)" title="Organ (anatomy)">organs</a> might stop working. Ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which makes it hard for sick people to move. </p>
<p>Five to nine out of every ten people who get sick with Ebola die.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Treatment">Treatment</span></h2>
<p>There is no cure for Ebola, but if people get care quickly from <a href="/Medical_doctor" title="Medical doctor">doctors</a> and <a href="/Nurse" title="Nurse">nurses</a> at a <a href="/Hospital" title="Hospital">hospital</a>, more of them live. People with Ebola need a lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from <a href="/Diarrhea" title="Diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, <a href="/Vomiting" title="Vomiting">vomiting</a>, and bleeding. The most important care is giving them water with a very small amount of salt and sugar in it. This is called <a href="/Oral_rehydration_therapy" title="Oral rehydration therapy">oral rehydration</a>. It helps to replace their fluids and blood. It is also important to give medicines in case they get bad <a href="/Blood_pressure" title="Blood pressure">blood pressure</a> and blood circulation.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Prevention">Prevention</span></h2>
<p>In December 2016, a study found the VSV-EBOV vaccine to be very effective (in the neighborhood of 70–100%) against the Ebola virus, making it the first vaccine against the disease.</p>
<p>Many Ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade prior to 2014, but as of October 2014, none had yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans.</p>
