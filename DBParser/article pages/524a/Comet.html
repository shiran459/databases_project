A <b>comet</b> is a <a href="/Sphere" title="Sphere">ball</a> of mostly <a href="/Ice" title="Ice">ice</a> that moves around in <a href="/Outer_space" title="Outer space">outer space</a>. Comets are often described as "dirty snowballs".  They are very different from <a href="/Asteroid" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a>.  The <a href="/Orbital_inclination" title="Orbital inclination">orbital inclinations</a> of comets are usually high and not near the <a href="/Ecliptic" title="Ecliptic">ecliptic</a> where most <a href="/Solar_system" title="Solar system">solar system</a> objects are found. Most of them are long-period comets and come from the <a href="/Kuiper_belt" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a>. That is very far away from the Sun, but some of them also come near enough to Earth for us to see at <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/night">night</a>.  </p>
<p>They have long "tails", because the Sun <a href="/Melt" title="Melt">melts</a> the ice. A comet's tail does not trail behind it, but points directly away from the Sun, because it is blown by the <a href="/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a>.
The hard centre of the comet is the <i><a href="/Comet_nucleus" title="Comet nucleus">nucleus</a></i>. It is one of the blackest things (lowest <a href="/Albedo" title="Albedo">albedo</a>) in the solar system. When <a href="/Light" title="Light">light</a> shone on the nucleus of <a href="/Halley's_Comet" title="Halley's Comet">Halley's Comet</a>, the comet reflected only 4% of the light back to us.</p>
<p><a href="/Periodic_comets" title="Periodic comets"><i>Periodic</i> comets</a> visit again and again. <i>Non-periodic</i> or <i>single-apparition</i> comets visit only once.</p>
<p>Comets sometimes break up, as <a href="/Comet_Biela" title="Comet Biela">Comet Biela</a> did in the 19th century.  <a href="/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9" title="Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> broke up, and the pieces hit <a href="/Jupiter_(planet)" title="Jupiter (planet)">Jupiter</a> in <a href="/1994" title="1994">1994</a>. Some comets orbit (go around) together in groups. <a href="/Astronomer" title="Astronomer">Astronomers</a> think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History_of_comets">History of comets</span></h2>
<p>In old times, people used to be scared of comets. They did not know what they were, or where they came from. Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth. They said that each time a comet appeared, it would bring bad luck with it. Whenever a comet appeared, a king would die. For example, the <a href="/Bayeux_Tapestry" title="Bayeux Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> shows the return of <a href="/Halley's_Comet" title="Halley's Comet">Halley's Comet</a> and the death of a king. Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine.  During the <a href="/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, <a href="/Astronomer" title="Astronomer">astronomers</a> started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a> on observations. <a href="/Tycho_Brahe" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> reasoned that comets did not come from the earth, and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon.</p>
<p><a href="/Edmond_Halley" title="Edmond Halley">Edmond Halley</a> reasoned that some comets are periodic, that is, they appear again after a certain number of years, and again and again. This led to the first prediction of a comet's return, <a href="/Halley's_Comet" title="Halley's Comet">Halley's Comet</a>, named after him.</p>
<p><a href="/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> also studied comets. He realised that comets make U-turns around the sun. He asked his friend Edmond Halley to publish this in his book <i><a href="/Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" title="Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a></i>. Before Newton said this, people believed that comets go in to the sun, then another comes out from behind the sun. </p>
<p>In later years some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets, especially <a href="/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>.</p>
<p>All this new information and research gave people confidence, but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods. One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that <a href="/Hell" title="Hell">hell</a> was, where souls would ride, being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space.</p>
<p>In modern times <a href="/Space_probe" title="Space probe">space probes</a> have visited comets to learn more about them.</p>
