<p>The Bible in Basic English<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> <a href="/Translation" title="Translation">translates</a> the commandments from Exodus in this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>{{sup|1}} And God said all these words: {{sup|2}} I am the Lord took you out of the land of <a href="/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, out of the <a href="/Prison" title="Prison">prison</a>-house. {{sup|3}} You are to have no other gods but me.</li>
<li>{{sup|4}} You are not to make an image or picture of anything in <a href="/Heaven" title="Heaven">heaven</a> or on the <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">earth</a> or in the waters under the earth: {{sup|5}} You may not go down on your faces before them or give them <a href="/Worship" title="Worship">worship</a>: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth <a href="/Generation" title="Generation">generation</a> of my haters; {{sup|6}} And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.</li>
<li>{{sup|7}} You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a <a href="/Sin" title="Sin">sinner</a> by the Lord</li>
<li>{{sup|8}} Keep in memory the <a href="/Sabbath" title="Sabbath">Sabbath</a> and let it be a holy day. {{sup|9}} On six days do all your work: {{sup|10}} But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day you are to do no work, you or your son or your daughter, your man-<a href="/Servant" title="Servant">servant</a> or your woman-servant, your <a href="/Cattle" title="Cattle">cattle</a> or the man from a strange country who is living among you: {{sup|11}} For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and everything in them, and he took his rest on the seventh day: for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy.</li>
<li>{{sup|12}} Give honour to your father and to your mother, so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_in_teachings_and_interpretation">Differences in teachings and interpretation</span></h2>
<p>These commandments are translated from ancient <a href="/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> to <a href="/Basic_English" title="Basic English">Basic English</a>, so the exact words chosen may not mean to us exactly what they meant to the Hebrews. There are a variety of interpretations of these commandments:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Images</dt>
</dl>



<p>One understanding on the commandment to not make "any image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above" is as from <a href="/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>: they hold that "likenesses" may be built and used, as long as the object is not <a href="/Worship" title="Worship">worshipped</a>. The <a href="/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> has a very similar position. Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the <a href="/Incarnation" title="Incarnation">incarnation</a> of an <a href="/Visible_spectrum" title="Visible spectrum">invisible</a> God as a visible human, Jesus, makes it alright to worship images (see <a href="/Iconoclasm" title="Iconoclasm">Iconoclasm</a>). But, for Jews, Muslims, and most other Christians that violates the commandment.</p>
<p><a href="/Jehovah's_Witnesses" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> criticize the use of all of the above, as well as the use of the cross. The <a href="/Amish" title="Amish">Amish</a> forbid any sort of image, such as <a href="/Photography" title="Photography">photos</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Sabbath day</dt>
</dl>
<p>{{main|Sabbath|Shabbat}}</p>
<p>Jews honor the Sabbath <i>(Shabbat)</i> on Saturday, the seventh day of the week on the <a href="/Hebrew_calendar" title="Hebrew calendar">Jewish calendar</a>.</p>
<p>Most <a href="/Christians" title="Christians">Christians</a> honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the <a href="/Resurrection" title="Resurrection">Resurrection</a> of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar.</p>
<p>Some conservative Christians are "Sabbatarians" (most of these follow the <a href="/Reformation" title="Reformation">Reformed</a> <a href="/Tradition" title="Tradition">traditions</a>). Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or <i>Lord's Day</i> is the new Sabbath, because the 4th commandment has never been <a href="/Revoke" title="Revoke">revoked</a> and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation <a href="/Ordinance" title="Ordinance">ordinance</a>.</p>
<p>Others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on Saturday, while Sunday as a day of worship, in reference to Acts 20:7: the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. Also, Jesus appeared to his followers on the "first day of the week" while they were in hiding.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>, and some others, believe that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in <a href="/Paganism" title="Paganism">paganism</a>, specifically <a href="/Sol_Invictus" title="Sol Invictus">Sol Invictus</a> and <a href="/Mithraism" title="Mithraism">Mithraism</a> (in which <a href="/Sun" title="Sun">sun</a> <a href="/God" title="God">god</a> worship took place on Sunday). Instead, Adventists keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation<sup class="reference" id="_ref-4"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the <a href="/2nd_century" title="2nd century">2nd</a> and <a href="/3rd_century" title="3rd century">3rd century</a>, but because of opposition to Judaism after the <a href="/Jewish-Roman_wars" title="Jewish-Roman wars">Jewish-Roman wars</a>, the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Married relations</dt>
</dl>

<p>To "be false to the married relation", called <a href="/Adultery" title="Adultery">adultery</a>, is when a married person has <a href="/Sexual_intercourse" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual relations</a> with a person other than his or her spouse. The Bible does not say whether or not this includes unmarried people having sex with each other, although some people think so.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Killing or murder</dt>
</dl>

<p>There are different <a href="/Translation" title="Translation">translations</a> of this commandment; the Hebrew words {{lang|he|לא תרצח}} are translated either as "thou shalt not kill" or "thou shalt not murder". Older Protestant translations of the Bible, those based on the <a href="/Vulgate" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it "Thou shalt not <a href="/Kill" title="Kill">kill</a>". Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use "You shall not <a href="/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a>". There are different opinions as to which translation is more faithful to the original.</p>
<p>The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God, are quoted in defense of the view that "murder" is more accurate.  Furthermore, the Hebrew word for "kill" is "{{lang|he|הרג}}" - "<i>harog</i>", while the Hebrew word for "murder" is "{{lang|he|רצח}}" - "<i>retzach</i>", which is found in the Ten Commandments "{{lang|he|לא תרצח}}" - "<i>lo tirtzach</i>".</p>
<p>In the <a href="/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, <a href="/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments. He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person, he might be judged for murder, and if he just looked with desire or <a href="/Lust" title="Lust">lust</a> at a woman, he had committed adultery in his heart.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-6"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<dl>
<dt>Stealing</dt>
</dl>

<p>Many <a href="/Theology" title="Theology">theologians</a> (such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt: <i>Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog</i> (1953)) suggest that commandment "you shall not steal" was originally intended against stealing people—abductions and <a href="/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as "you shall not kidnap" (e.g. as stated by Rashi).</p>

<dl>
<dt>False witness</dt>
</dl>

<p>To "give false witness" called <a href="/Lying" title="Lying">lying</a>, may include all lying, or only lying in court, which is called <a href="/Perjury" title="Perjury">perjury</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Different_numbering">Different numbering</span></h3>
<p>The Bible does not number the commandments. Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways. The Jews, followed by Christian <a href="/Protestant" title="Protestant">Protestants</a>, end the first commandment with "You are to have no other gods but me." as above. <a href="/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholics</a> and <a href="/Lutheran" title="Lutheran">Lutherans</a> end the first commandment at "I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws." and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man's wife from the desire for other things he owns.</p>
<p>The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten important statements, there are 14 or 15 in all. While the Bible itself gives the count as "10", using the Hebrew phrase <i>ʻaseret had'varim</i>—translated as <i>the 10 words</i>, <i>statements</i> or <i>things</i>, this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being "the Ten Commandments".<sup class="reference" id="_ref-7"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Various religions divide the commandments differently.  The table below shows those differences.

</center></p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Ritual_Decalogue">The Ritual Decalogue</span></h2>

<p>The term "Ten Commandments" generally applies to the list mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. However, there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 31:18 (where the stones are created), Exodus 32:19 (where the tablets are broken) and Exodus 34. This story lists a very different set of commandments. This version is sometimes called "Ritual Decalogue". <a href="/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" title="Johann Wolfgang von Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> and the people after him who followed the <a href="/Documentary_hypothesis" title="Documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, note that Exodus 34:28 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones. These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments, and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments, now known as the <i>Ritual Decalogue</i> (as opposed to the better-known "Ethical Decalogue"). The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments.</p>
