Typically, Linux is <a href="/Package_management_system" title="Package management system">packaged</a> in a form known as a <i><a href="/Linux_distribution" title="Linux distribution">Linux distribution</a></i>, for both desktop and server use. Some of the popular mainstream Linux distributions are <a href="/Debian" title="Debian">Debian</a>, <a href="/Ubuntu_(operating_system)" title="Ubuntu (operating system)">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="/Linux_Mint" title="Linux Mint">Linux Mint</a>, <a href="/Fedora_(operating_system)" title="Fedora (operating system)">Fedora</a>, <a href="/OpenSUSE" title="OpenSUSE">openSUSE</a>, <a href="/Arch_Linux" title="Arch Linux">Arch Linux</a> and <a href="/Gentoo_Linux" title="Gentoo Linux">Gentoo</a>, together with commercial <a href="/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux" title="Red Hat Enterprise Linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> and <a href="/SUSE_Linux_Enterprise_Server" title="SUSE Linux Enterprise Server">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</a> distributions. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting <a href="/System_software" title="System software">utilities</a> and <a href="/Library_(computer_science)" title="Library (computer science)">libraries</a>, and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution's intended use.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_Linux_was_made">How Linux was made</span></h2>
<p>In the 1980s, many people liked to use an operating system called <a href="/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a>. But because it restricted the user from sharing and improving the system, some people made a new operating system that would work like Unix but which anybody could share or improve. <a href="/MINIX" title="MINIX">MINIX</a>, similar to Unix, was used as a teaching tool for university students to learn how operating systems worked. MINIX also restricted its sharing and improvement by its users.</p>
<p>A group of people called the <a href="/GNU" title="GNU">GNU</a> project wrote different parts of a new operating system called GNU, but it did not have all the parts an operating system needs to work. In 1991 <a href="/Linus_Torvalds" title="Linus Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> began to work on a replacement for MINIX that would be free to use, and which would not cost anything. Linus started the project when he was attending the <a href="/University_of_Helsinki" title="University of Helsinki">University of Helsinki</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-15"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-16"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> This eventually became the <a href="/Linux_kernel" title="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a>.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds shared the Linux kernel on some internet groups for <a href="/MINIX" title="MINIX">MINIX</a> users. Linus first called the operating system "Freax". The name Freax came from joining up the English words "free" and "freak", and adding an X to the name because Unix has an X in its name. Ari Lemmke, who worked with Linus at the University, was responsible for the <a href="/Server" title="Server">servers</a> that Freax was stored on. Ari did not think Freax was a good name, so he called the project "Linux" without asking Linus. Later, Linus agreed that Linux was a better name for his project.</p>
<p>Linux relied on software code from MINIX at first. But, with code from the GNU system available for free, he decided it would be good for Linux if it could use that code, instead of code from MINIX. The GNU General Public License is a software license that lets people change any part of the code they want to, as long as they share any changes they make with the people they give their software to and allow them to redistribute it for free or for a price . The software from GNU was all licensed under the GNU General Public License, so Linus and the other people who worked on Linux could use it too.</p>
<p>To make the Linux kernel suitable for use with the code from the GNU Project, Linus Torvalds started a switch from his original license (which did not allow people to sell it) to the GNU <a href="/GPL" title="GPL">GPL</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-17"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Linux and GNU developers worked together to integrate GNU code with Linux to make a free operating system.</p>
<p>Since 1991, thousands of <a href="/Programmer" title="Programmer">programmers</a> and <a href="/Company" title="Company">companies</a> have worked to make Linux better including <a href="/Google" title="Google">Google</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tux_the_penguin">Tux the penguin</span></h2>


<p>
The mascot of Linux is a <a href="/Cartoon" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a> <a href="/Penguin" title="Penguin">penguin</a> named "<a href="/Tux" title="Tux">Tux</a>". When a person sees the penguin on <a href="/Software" title="Software">software</a> and <a href="/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a>, it means that it will work with Linux, and sometimes all systems that are like Unix.</p>
<p>The idea of the penguin came from the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds. The image was made by a man named Larry Ewing in a competition to create a logo. The image, Tux, did not win, but it was picked as a mascot later.</p>
<p>Tux has now become a symbol for Linux, and sometimes even for open source. He can be seen in many different places and often, when people refer to Linux, they think about Tux. Tux has even been included in many <a href="/Video_games" title="Video games">video games</a>, such as Super Tux (like Super Mario Bros.), Tux Racer (where players race Tux down an icy hill) and Pingus (like Lemmings).</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Servers_and_supercomputers">Servers and supercomputers</span></h3>


<p> 
Linux has mainly been used as a <a href="/Server_(computing)" title="Server (computing)">server</a> operating system, and has risen to be known by a lot of people in that area; <a href="/Netcraft" title="Netcraft">Netcraft</a> reported in February 2008 that five of the ten best internet hosting companies run Linux on their <a href="/Server" title="Server">web servers</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-24"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> This is because of its stability and uptime, and the fact that desktop software with a <a href="/GUI" title="GUI">graphical user interface</a> for servers is often unneeded.</p>
<p>Linux is commonly used as an operating system for <a href="/Supercomputer" title="Supercomputer">supercomputers</a>. As of June 2015, out of the top 500 systems, 488 (97.6%) run Linux.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-25"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pronounciation">Pronounciation</span></h2>
<p>In 1992, Torvalds explained how he pronounces the word <i>Linux</i>:</p>
<p>{{cquote|'li' is pronounced with a short [ee] sound: compare prInt, mInImal etc.  'nux' is also short, non-diphthong, like in pUt.  It's partly due to minix: linux was just my working name for the thing, and as I wrote it to replace minix on my system, the result is what it is...  linus' minix became linux.|Linus Torvalds|comp.os.linux newsgroup<sup class="reference" id="_ref-26"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>}}
</p>
<p>Torvalds has made available an audio sample which indicates his own pronunciation, in English and Swedish.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-27"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-28"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some English speakers pronounce the name as lee-narks or lee-nix or lie-nix. According to Torvalds, that is incorrect pronunciation. {{fact|date=July 2010}}</p>
