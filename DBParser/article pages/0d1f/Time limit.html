<p>A <b>time limit</b> is a <a href="/Time_horizon" title="Time horizon">time horizon</a> that is imposed on everyone at once. </p>
<p>It may be used to try to achieve <a href="/Fairness" title="Fairness">fairness</a> in some system of <a href="/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethics</a>.  For instance, if poor people and rich people are debating something, a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work, and lose.</p>
<p>Time limits are very important in <a href="/Accounting" title="Accounting">accounting</a> so that everyone can report their results (for <a href="/Tax" title="Tax">tax</a> and <a href="/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/purpose">purposes</a>) at the same time.  This in turn creates <a href="/Deadline" title="Deadline">deadlines</a> for the <a href="/Accountant" title="Accountant">accountant</a> and those reporting.</p>
<p>However, the deadline is imposed by an <a href="/Authority" title="Authority">authority</a>, whereas the time limit is imposed by a system.  So there can be <a href="/Slack" title="Slack">slack</a> in a deadline, so that results do not have to be reported always very fast.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States of America</a>, the <a href="/End_of_the_calendar_year" title="End of the calendar year">end of the calendar year</a> on <a href="/December_31" title="December 31">December 31</a> is the time limit for taxes, but the <a href="/Deadline" title="Deadline">deadline</a> for reporting is <a href="/April_15" title="April 15">April 15</a>.  Sometimes the government allows more time, as it did for the families of those who were killed in the <a href="/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.</p>
