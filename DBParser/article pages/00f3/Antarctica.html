Antarctica is covered by an <a href="/Ice_sheet" title="Ice sheet">ice sheet</a> about four kilometres thick. Under the ice it is mostly land, although the <a href="/Ice_shelf" title="Ice shelf">ice shelves</a> are over the ocean.  The Transantarctic Mountains divide the land between <a href="/East_Antarctica" title="East Antarctica">East Antarctica</a> in the <a href="/Eastern_Hemisphere" title="Eastern Hemisphere">Eastern Hemisphere</a> and West Antarctica in the <a href="/Western_Hemisphere" title="Western Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>. </p>
<p>Antarctica has some important features hidden by the ice. One is <a href="/Lake_Vostok" title="Lake Vostok">Lake Vostok</a>, which has been covered by ice for at least 15 million years. The lake is 250 km long and 50 km wide.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-tdg"><a href="#_note-tdg" title="">[5]</a></sup> Another is the huge Gamburtsev mountain chain, which are the size of the <a href="/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a>, yet entirely buried under the ice.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Amos"><a href="#_note-Amos" title="">[6]</a></sup> The Gamburtsev range has a nearby massive <a href="/Rift_(geology)" title="Rift (geology)">rift valley</a> similar to the <a href="/East_Africa" title="East Africa">East African</a> <a href="/Great_Rift_Valley" title="Great Rift Valley">Great Rift Valley</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Plants">Plants</span></h3>
<p>Few <a href="/Embryophyte" title="Embryophyte">land plants</a> grow in Antarctica. This is because Antarctica does not have much moisture (water), <a href="/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a>, good <a href="/Soil" title="Soil">soil</a>, or a warm temperature. Plants usually only grow for a few weeks in the summer. However, <a href="/Moss" title="Moss">moss</a>, <a href="/Lichen" title="Lichen">lichen</a> and <a href="/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a> do grow.  The most important organisms in Antarctica are the <a href="/Plankton" title="Plankton">plankton</a> which grow in the ocean.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Animals">Animals</span></h3>
<p>One important source of food in the Antarctic is the <a href="/Krill" title="Krill">krill</a>, which is a general term for the small shrimp-like <a href="/Marine_biology" title="Marine biology">marine</a> <a href="/Crustacea" title="Crustacea">crustaceans</a>. Krill are  near the bottom of the <a href="/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chain</a>: they feed on <a href="/Phytoplankton" title="Phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="/Zooplankton" title="Zooplankton">zooplankton</a>. Krill are a food form suitable for the larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet. So <a href="/Whale" title="Whale">whales</a>, <a href="/Penguin" title="Penguin">penguins</a>, <a href="/Pinniped" title="Pinniped">seals</a>, and even some of the <a href="/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a> that live in the Antarctic, depend on krill.</p>
<p>Whales are the largest animals in the ocean, and in Antarctica. They are <a href="/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, not <a href="/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>. That means that they breathe <a href="/Air" title="Air">air</a> and do not lay <a href="/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a>. Many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around Antarctica. 
<a href="/Whaler" title="Whaler">Whalers</a> have hunted whales for hundreds of years, for <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a> and <a href="/Blubber" title="Blubber">blubber</a>.  Nowadays most whaling is done in the Antarctic area. </p>
<p><a href="/Penguin" title="Penguin">Penguins</a> only live south of the equator. Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica. The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet (1.2m) tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds (40 kg). The smallest kinds are only about one foot (30 cm) tall. Penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly. They have <a href="/Black" title="Black">black</a> backs and wings with <a href="/White" title="White">white</a> fronts.  Their <a href="/Feather" title="Feather">feathers</a> are very tightly packed and make a thick cover.  They also have a layer of woolly <a href="/Down" title="Down">down</a> under the feathers.  The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/waterproof">waterproof</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_b"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup>   A thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm.  Penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean.  They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks.  They nest together in a huge group.</p>

<p>
</p>


<p>For a long time, people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of Earth. They thought this <i>Terra Australis</i> would "balance" the lands in the north like <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>. People have believed this from the times of <a href="/Ptolemy" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (1st century AD). He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world. Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps. In the late 17th century, people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the <a href="/Myth" title="Myth">mythical</a> "Antarctica". However, <a href="/Geography" title="Geography">geographers</a> still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was.</p>
<p>European maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain <a href="/James_Cook" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>'s ships, HMS <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i>, crossed the <a href="/Antarctic_Circle" title="Antarctic Circle">Antarctic Circle</a> on 17 January 1773, in December 1773.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mariner"><a href="#_note-mariner" title="">[10]</a></sup> They crossed it again in January 1774.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-mariner_b"><a href="#_note-mariner" title="">[10]</a></sup> In fact, Cook did come within about {{convert|75|mi|km}} of the Antarctic <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coast">coast</a>. However, he was forced to go back because of ice in January 1773.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_c"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The first <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/confirm">confirmed</a> sighting of Antarctica were by three different men. According to different organizations,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-12"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-13"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-14"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-15"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-16"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> ships captained by three men saw Antarctica in 1820. The three men were Fabian von Bellingshausen (a captain in the <a href="/Russian_Imperial_Navy" title="Russian Imperial Navy">Russian Imperial Navy</a>), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the <a href="/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>), and Nathaniel Palmer (an American seal hunter out of Stonington, <a href="/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>). The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer <a href="/John_Davis_(sealer)" title="John Davis (sealer)">John Davis</a>. He landed on West Antarctica on 7 February 1821. However, some <a href="/History" title="History">historians</a> are not sure about this claim.</p>
<p>People began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them. This was slow work because they could only work in the summer.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_d"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup> At last a map was made, and people began to talk about exploring the land, not only the sea.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_e"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, this would have been very hard work. They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica. Then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land.</p>
<p>The first serious exploration of the Antarctic land was the <a href="/Nimrod_Expedition" title="Nimrod Expedition">Nimrod Expedition</a> led by <a href="/Ernest_Shackleton" title="Ernest Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a> in 1907–09. They were the first to climb <a href="/Mount_Erebus" title="Mount Erebus">Mount Erebus</a> and to reach the <a href="/South_Magnetic_Pole" title="South Magnetic Pole">South Magnetic Pole</a>. Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909. They were the first humans to cross the <a href="/Ross_Ice_Shelf" title="Ross Ice Shelf">Ross Ice Shelf</a>, and the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the <a href="/Beardmore_Glacier" title="Beardmore Glacier">Beardmore Glacier</a>). They were the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. </p>
<p><a href="/Robert_Falcon_Scott" title="Robert Falcon Scott">Robert Falcon Scott</a>, the most well known of all of the explorers,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_f"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup> wanted to be the first man to reach the South Pole. At the same time, another team from <a href="/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a> lead by <a href="/Roald_Amundsen" title="Roald Amundsen">Roald Amundsen</a> started. They both raced each other to the South Pole, but in the end Amundsen won because he had made a good use of his sleigh dogs. Scott had used ponies and motor sleds, but when he got to the South Pole he found a message from Amundsen, showing that he had beaten Scott.</p>
<p>On his way back, Scott and three companions met a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blizzard">blizzard</a> and froze to death while waiting for it to finish. The people who found him eight months later also found his records and <a href="/Diary" title="Diary">diary</a>, which he had written to the day he died.</p>
<p><a href="/Climate_change" title="Climate change">Climate change</a> and <a href="/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a> are showing effects in Antarctica, particularly the <a href="/Antarctic_Peninsula" title="Antarctic Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="People">People</span></h3>
<p>People of the Antarctic live in there for a short time to learn more about Antarctica, so most of the people who live there are scientists. Most are in national science stations on the coast. Some bases are far from the sea, for example at the <a href="/South_pole" title="South pole">South pole</a>. They study the <a href="/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a>, animals, <a href="/Glacier" title="Glacier">glaciers</a>, and the <a href="/Earth's_atmosphere" title="Earth's atmosphere">earth's atmosphere</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_g"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup> Some scientists <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drill">drill</a> <a href="/Ice_core" title="Ice core">ice cores</a> to find out about the weather long ago. People who work in the Antarctic must be careful, because a blizzard can start any time and any where. When they go far away from their shelter, they must always take lots of food just in case.</p>
<p>Today people explore Antarctica using <a href="/Snowmobile" title="Snowmobile">snowmobiles</a>, which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads. Many come to Antarctica just for a short visit, as a trip. There are companies in South America that have vacations to Antarctica, so people pay to go there in a ship. Some people may just take their own boats.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-lifepac_h"><a href="#_note-lifepac" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
