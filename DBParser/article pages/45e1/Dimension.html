<p><b>Dimensions</b> are the way we see, measure and experience our world . By Using up and down, right to left, back to front, hot and cold, how heavy and how long as well as more advanced concepts from <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>. One way to define a dimension is to look at the <a href="/Degree_of_freedom" title="Degree of freedom">degrees of freedom</a> or the way an object can move in a specific space. There are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitions. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts. </p>
<p>In a <a href="/Vector_space" title="Vector space">vector space</a>, (a vector is an opened ended line) a dimension is equal to the  <a href="/Cardinality" title="Cardinality">cardinality</a> or number of directions of vectors or lines. It is also equal to the number of the largest group of straight line directions of that space. "Normal" objects in everyday life are specified by three dimensions, which are usually called <a href="/Length" title="Length">length</a>, <a href="/Width" title="Width">width</a> and <a href="/Depth" title="Depth">depth</a>. Mathematicians call this concept <a href="/Euclidean_space" title="Euclidean space">Euclidean space</a>.</p>
<p>Dimensions can be used to measure <a href="/Position" title="Position">position</a> too. The <a href="/Distance" title="Distance">distance</a> to a position from a <a href="/Start" title="Start">starting</a> place can be measured in the length, width and height <a href="/Direction" title="Direction">directions</a>. These distances are a measure of the position.</p>
<p>Sometimes a fourth (<a href="/4D" title="4D">4D</a>) dimension, <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a>, is used to show the <a href="/Position" title="Position">position</a> of an <a href="/Event" title="Event">event</a> in <a href="/Time" title="Time">time</a> and <a href="/Space_(physics)" title="Space (physics)">space</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Dimensions">Other Dimensions</span></h2>
<p>In modern <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a>, people use other dimensions. Dimensions like <a href="/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> and <a href="/Weight" title="Weight">weight</a> can be used to show the position of something in less simple <a href="/Space_(physics)" title="Space (physics)">spaces</a>. Scientist study those dimension with <a href="/Dimensional_analysis" title="Dimensional analysis">dimensional analysis</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">Mathematicians</a> also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the <a href="/World" title="World">world</a>. The <a href="/Rule" title="Rule">rules</a> for doing <a href="/Arithmetic" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dimensions_and_vectors">Dimensions and vectors</span></h2>
<p><a href="/Vector" title="Vector">Vectors</a> are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in <a href="/Engineering" title="Engineering">engineering</a> and <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a>, and sometimes in  <a href="/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>A vector is a list of <a href="/Number" title="Number">numbers</a>. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors.</p>
<p>For example, if Jane wants to know the position of Sally, Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position. If Jane and Sally are in the world, there are three dimensions. Therefore, Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position. The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sally's distance north of Jane</li>
<li>Sally's distance east of Jane</li>
<li>Sally's height above Jane</li>
</ol>
