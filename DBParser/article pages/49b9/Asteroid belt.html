The <b>asteroid belt</b> or <b>main belt</b> is a ring of small and large rocks and dust between the <a href="/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbits</a> of <a href="/Mars_(planet)" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a> and <a href="/Jupiter_(planet)" title="Jupiter (planet)">Jupiter</a>. The biggest object in the asteroid belt is <a href="/Ceres(planet)" title="Ceres(planet)">Ceres</a>, a <a href="/Dwarf_planet" title="Dwarf planet">dwarf planet</a>. The <a href="/Kirkwood_gap" title="Kirkwood gap">Kirkwood gaps</a> separate the asteroid belt into several groups.</p>
<p>Most <a href="/Asteroid" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a>s orbit at 2 to 3 times the distance between Earth and the Sun. Planets that are "inside" - or before - the asteroid belt (which means they are closer to the sun) are called <i>inner planets.</i> Planets that are "outside" - that is, after - the asteroid belt are called <i>outer planets</i>: so <a href="/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>, <a href="/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a>, <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, and <a href="/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> are <i>inner planets,</i> while <a href="/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="/Saturn_(planet)" title="Saturn (planet)">Saturn</a>, <a href="/Uranus" title="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="/Neptune" title="Neptune">Neptune</a> are the <i>outer planets.</i></p>

<p>In 1802, shortly after discovering <a href="/2_Pallas" title="2 Pallas">2 Pallas</a>, <a href="/Heinrich_Olbers" title="Heinrich Olbers">Heinrich Olbers</a> suggested to <a href="/William_Herschel" title="William Herschel">William Herschel</a> that <a href="/Ceres" title="Ceres">Ceres</a> and <a href="/Pallas" title="Pallas">Pallas</a> were fragments of a much larger planet that once occupied the Marsâ€“Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> This <a href="/Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy needed to destroy a planet, and with the belt's low combined mass (only about 4% of the mass of the <a href="/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a>) do not support the hypothesis. Also, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids are difficult to explain if they come from the same planet.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Today, most scientists accept that the asteroids never formed a planet at all.</p>
<p>In general, the <a href="/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System" title="Formation and evolution of the Solar System">formation and evolution of the Solar System</a> happened when a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of <a href="/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> to form the Sun and <a href="/Planetesimal" title="Planetesimal">planetesimals</a>, and eventually the planets.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the rocky planets and the <a href="/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giants</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/Planetesimal" title="Planetesimal">Planetesimals</a> in the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly disturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, while occasionally colliding.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-icarus153"><a href="#_note-icarus153" title="">[4]</a></sup> In regions where the velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals was more common than accretion,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-5"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. </p>
