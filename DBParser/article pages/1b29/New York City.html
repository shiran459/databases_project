<p>The oldest <a href="/Borough" title="Borough">part</a> of the city, the island of <a href="/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, still has its original <a href="/Lenape" title="Lenape">Lenape</a> <a href="/Native_American" title="Native American">Native American</a> name. Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canarsees had lived there for many thousands of years, New York City was first explored by <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europeans</a> in the 1500s.  <a href="/Florence" title="Florence">Florentine</a> explorer <a href="/Giovanni_da_Verrazzano" title="Giovanni da Verrazzano">Giovanni da Verrazzano</a> found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer <a href="/Henry_Hudson" title="Henry Hudson">Henry Hudson</a> named the <a href="/Hudson_River" title="Hudson River">Hudson River</a> in 1609.</p>
<p>New York City was settled by Europeans from <a href="/The_Netherlands" title="The Netherlands">The Netherlands</a> in 1624. The Dutch called the whole area of New York <b>"Nieuw Nederland"</b> (<a href="/New_Netherland" title="New Netherland">New Netherland</a>) and they named a <a href="/Fort" title="Fort">fort</a> and town on the south end of Manhattan Island <b>Nieuw Amsterdam</b> (New <a href="/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>),<sup class="reference" id="_ref-nieuw"><a href="#_note-nieuw" title="">[10]</a></sup> after the capital city of the Netherlands, which was to become present-day New York. The English took over the colony in 1664 during the second <a href="/Anglo-Dutch_War" title="Anglo-Dutch War">Anglo-Dutch War</a>. They changed the name to <b>New York</b>, to honor the <a href="/Duke_of_York" title="Duke of York">Duke of York</a>, who later became King <a href="/James_II" title="James II">James II</a> of <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>.  The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting. They were afraid of the English <a href="/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, so they traded the town to England for the colony of <a href="/Surinam" title="Surinam">Surinam</a> in <a href="/South_America" title="South America">South America</a>, which they thought was worth more money.</p>
<p>By the time the English took New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen (<a href="/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>), Vlissingen (<a href="/Flushing" title="Flushing">Flushing</a>), and Nieuw Haarlem (<a href="/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>). There were already some English towns in the area also, such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens. <a href="/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a>, English and other people had been living together in New York for a long time.</p>
<p>New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city.  The  important <a href="/Battle_of_Long_Island" title="Battle of Long Island">Battle of Long Island</a> of the <a href="/American_Revolution" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> was fought in Brooklyn in 1776. New York was the capital of the United States under the <a href="/Articles_of_Confederation" title="Articles of Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> from 1785 to 1788.  When the <a href="/US_Constitution" title="US Constitution">US Constitution</a> was made, it stayed as the capital from 1789 until 1790.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-11"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1898, the cities of New York and Brooklyn came together with the Bronx, Staten Island, and the western towns in Queens County to make Greater New York. This is the total area of the City of New York today.  Around this time, many new <a href="/Immigrant" title="Immigrant">immigrants</a> came into New York City.  They came in at <a href="/Ellis_Island" title="Ellis Island">Ellis Island</a>, an island in New York's harbor near the <a href="/Statue_of_Liberty" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>.  Many of them then moved to the <a href="/Lower_East_Side" title="Lower East Side">Lower East Side</a> neighborhood in Manhattan, which had over a million people living in just a few square miles.</p>
<p>Early in the twentieth century, with better transportation, more people moved to outer parts of the greater city, and many <a href="/Commuting" title="Commuting">commuted</a> to Manhattan. Many <a href="/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a> and other big buildings were put up to provide places to work.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Geography">Geography</span></h2>


<p>Most of New York City is on three islands near the <a href="/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, although one part is on the mainland of <a href="/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. The city includes all of <a href="/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan Island</a> and <a href="/Staten_Island" title="Staten Island">Staten Island</a>, and the western end of <a href="/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>. There are also many smaller islands.</p>
<p>The city is divided into five major parts called <i>boroughs</i>. Each one is also a county. They are:</p>



<p>Water divides several parts of the city.

The <a href="/East_River" title="East River">East River</a> forms the border between Manhattan on one side, and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side. The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx (except for a small part of Manhattan that is on the mainland). Part of <a href="/Long_Island_Sound" title="Long Island Sound">Long Island Sound</a> separates the Bronx and Queens. Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens. Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water, such as <a href="/Rockaway" title="Rockaway">Rockaway</a> in Queens and <a href="/City_Island" title="City Island">City Island</a> in the Bronx. A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and belongs to the <a href="/United_Nations_Headquarters" title="United Nations Headquarters">United Nations Headquarters</a>.</p>
<p>The hallmark of New York city is its many <a href="/Skyscraper" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a>, especially in Manhattan. In New York City there are about 5600 skyscrapers. 48 of them are over 200 metres tall, which is the highest number of skyscrapers in one area in the world.</p>
