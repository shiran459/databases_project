<p><b>Drunk driving</b> (<b>Drink driving</b> in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> and <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>) is the act of driving a <a href="/Motor" title="Motor">motor</a> <a href="/Vehicle" title="Vehicle">vehicle</a> (<a href="/Car" title="Car">car</a>, <a href="/Truck" title="Truck">truck</a>, etc.) while under the effects of <a href="/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">alcohol</a>.  Drunk driving is <a href="/Illegal" title="Illegal">illegal</a> in most areas of the world.  In some places, driving a motorless vehicle such as a <a href="/Bicycle" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> while drunk is also illegal.</p>
<p>Most <i>areas that make laws</i> (<i><a href="/Jurisdiction" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdictions</a></i>) started with DWI (driving while <a href="/Intoxication" title="Intoxication">intoxicated</a>) laws, banning just alcohol. Later, most changed them to DUI (driving under the <a href="/Influence" title="Influence">influence</a>) laws, adding other <a href="/Drug" title="Drug">drugs</a> to those banned while driving. The most common <a href="/Blood_alcohol_content" title="Blood alcohol content">blood alcohol content</a> (BAC) limit in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> is 0.08% for the legal meaning of drunk. Only three states still use the more lax, original standard of 0.10%.  Many jurisdictions add extra <a href="/Punishment" title="Punishment">penalties</a> (more jail time and/or a longer <a href="/DUI_program" title="DUI program">DUI program</a>) in cases where the driver's BAC is over 0.20%.</p>

<p>The first place in the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> to adopt laws against drunk driving was the <a href="/State" title="State">state</a> of <a href="/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> in <a href="/1910" title="1910">1910</a>, with <a href="/California" title="California">California</a> (<a href="/1911" title="1911">1911</a>) and others doing the same later. Early laws simply banned driving while drunk, with no mention of what BAC was banned (which means how drunk the person is). The state of Georgia was one of the last states to make laws against drunk driving. One of the years with the most alcohol related crashes was 1982. The year 1982 had 26,173 alcohol related deaths due to drunk driving.</p>
<p>In the US, most of the laws were greatly tightened in the early <a href="/1980s" title="1980s">1980s</a>, largely due to pressure from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) and <a class="external text" href="http://www.yaerd.org" rel="nofollow">Young Adults Educating Responsible Drinking</a>.</p></div>
