<p><b>Archaeology</b> is the study of the <a href="/Past" title="Past">past</a> by looking for the remains and artifacts (<a href="/History" title="History">historical things</a>) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old <a href="/Coin" title="Coin">coins</a>, <a href="/Tool" title="Tool">tools</a>, <a href="/Building" title="Building">buildings</a>, and inscriptions.  Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.</p>
<p>Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from.</p>

<p>When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a <a href="/University" title="University">university</a> or <a href="/Museum" title="Museum">museum</a>. They record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As <a href="/Human_settlement" title="Human settlement">settlements</a> (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient <a href="/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.</p>

<p><a href="/Archaeologist" title="Archaeologist">Archaeologists</a> do not all study the same <a href="/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilizations</a>, they specialize in different areas of interest. Some fields of interest include <a href="/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> (these specialists are called <a href="/Egyptologist" title="Egyptologist">Egyptologists</a>), <a href="/Ancient_China" title="Ancient China">Ancient China</a>, or the <a href="/Vikings" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>. Archaeologists study every <a href="/Civilization" title="Civilization">civilization</a> that is known, especially the ones where there is no written <a href="/History" title="History">history</a>. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the <a href="/Human_evolution" title="Human evolution">beginning of human life</a> in Africa, or study <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for <a href="/Shipwreck" title="Shipwreck">sunken ships</a> or <a href="/City" title="City">cities</a> that have been lost under the sea.</p>

<p><a href="/Stonehenge" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, in <a href="/England" title="England">England</a>, is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include the <a href="/Roman_Forum" title="Roman Forum">Roman Forum</a>, <a href="/Angkor_Wat" title="Angkor Wat">Angkor Wat</a>, <a href="/Machu_Picchu" title="Machu Picchu">Machu Picchu</a>, and <a href="/Great_Zimbabwe" title="Great Zimbabwe">Great Zimbabwe</a>. In many countries, <a href="/Government" title="Government">governments</a> and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.</p>
<p>Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new <a href="/Building" title="Building">buildings</a>. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people who are building often don't have a lot of time. Many times as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are very important.</p>
