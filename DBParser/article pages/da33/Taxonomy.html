<b>Taxonomy</b> is a branch of <a href="/Science" title="Science">science</a>. It is about the <a href="/Law" title="Law">laws</a> and <a href="/Principle" title="Principle">principles</a> of classifying things.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> From one type of taxonomy, many classifications might be produced.</p>
<p>The best-known kind of taxonomy is used for the <a href="/Biological_classification" title="Biological classification">classification</a> of lifeforms (living and extinct).  Each organism has a scientific name.  This name is part of the <b><a href="/Biological_classification" title="Biological classification">biological classification</a></b> of that <a href="/Species" title="Species">species</a>.  The name is the same all over the world, so scientists from different places can understand each other.  In addition, a species has a position in the <a href="/Tree_of_life_(biology)" title="Tree of life (biology)">tree of life</a>.  Thus the <a href="/Crow" title="Crow">crow</a> is <i>Corvus corone</i>, a member of the <a href="/Corvidae" title="Corvidae">Corvidae</a> <a href="/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>, and they are <a href="/Passerine" title="Passerine">passerine</a> <a href="/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>.  That is well agreed, but the classification of some groups is not agreed at present, and often several classifications are being discussed.</p>
<p>Living things are classified into three <a href="/Domain_(biology)" title="Domain (biology)">domains</a>: <a href="/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="/Archaea" title="Archaea">archaea</a> and <a href="/Eukaryotes" title="Eukaryotes">eukaryotes</a>. The highest rank in a domain is the <a href="/Kingdom_(biology)" title="Kingdom (biology)">kingdom</a>. Each kingdom has many smaller groups in it, called <a href="/Phylum" title="Phylum">phyla</a>.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Each phylum has more smaller groups in it, called <a href="/Class_(biology)" title="Class (biology)">classes</a>. This pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them. Each species is put into a group because of what it does, how and what it eats, special body parts, and so on. At the end of the pattern, the groups (<a href="/Genus" title="Genus">genera</a>) are very small. Then each species in the genus is given its own name.</p>
<p>When someone writes about a living thing and its formal scientific name, they write the genus and species name. This is known as <a href="/Binomial_nomenclature" title="Binomial nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>, because it uses two names for each <a href="/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a>. The first is the <a href="/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> name, and the second is the <a href="/Species" title="Species">species</a> in that genus. The scientific name of the <a href="/Domestic_cat" title="Domestic cat">domestic cat</a> is <i>Felis catus</i>. Sometimes it is enough to write <i>F. catus</i>.</p>
<p>These are the major groups (<a href="/Taxon" title="Taxon">ranks</a>) used in taxonomy:
<a href="/Kingdom_(biology)" title="Kingdom (biology)">Kingdom</a> --&gt; <a href="/Phylum" title="Phylum">Phylum</a> --&gt; <a href="/Class_(biology)" title="Class (biology)">Class</a> --&gt; <a href="/Order_(biology)" title="Order (biology)">Order</a> --&gt; <a href="/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">Family</a> --&gt; <a href="/Genus" title="Genus">Genus</a> --&gt; <a href="/Species" title="Species">Species</a></p>
<p>Some <a href="/Mnemonic" title="Mnemonic">mnemonics</a> (sayings to help a person remember something):
</p>
<ul>
<li>King Phillip Came Over From Greater Spain</li>
</ul>

<p>When people started naming species, <a href="/Latin_language" title="Latin language">Latin</a> was a language widely used in <a href="/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. All species names are still written in Latin. This has some advantages. Since Latin is no longer spoken, it is unchanging, and is owned by no-one. It gets over the problem of every language having its own names for animals and plants.</p>
<p>Scientists used to write the official description of each new species in Latin. On 1 January 2012, the <a href="/International_Botanical_Congress" title="International Botanical Congress">International Botanical Congress</a> changed to allow English (as well as Latin) for describing new plant species.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature" title="International Code of Zoological Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> recommends choosing a language that is widely used, and that is used in the places where the species lives.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cladism">Cladism</span></h2>
<p>An important modern approach to taxonomy is <a href="/Clade" title="Clade">cladism</a>. This approach is based on the branching (tree-like) course of <a href="/Evolution" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. Like traditional <a href="/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus">Linnaean</a> classification, it uses <a href="/Traits" title="Traits">traits</a> to decide on the branches of the classification. It insists on groups being <a href="/Monophyletic" title="Monophyletic">monophyletic</a>. This has the effect that <a href="/Birds" title="Birds">birds</a> are not a class but a sub-group of <a href="/Dinosaurs" title="Dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>. It also means the ranking system described above would be abolished.</p>
<p>So cladism has different principles of taxonomy, and produces a different kind of taxonomy. Decisions, where possible, are supported by <a href="/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> <a href="/Sequence_analysis" title="Sequence analysis">sequence analysis</a>. Present-day <a href="/Biological_classification" title="Biological classification">biological classification</a> is a mixture of the old Linnaean and the modern cladistic principles of taxonomy. In parts, it is changing rapidly. The classifications presented in Wikipedia at present are often a compromise between the two systems. The details are regularly discussed.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Turmoil_in_taxonomy">Turmoil in taxonomy</span></h3>
<p>Today, there are many changes in the classification of living things. This turmoil in taxonomy has led to many alternative <a href="/Biological_classification" title="Biological classification">classifications</a>. It is caused partly from the move from <a href="/Linnaeus" title="Linnaeus">Linnaean</a> to <a href="/Cladistics" title="Cladistics">cladistic</a> principles,<sup class="reference" id="_ref-Ridley"><a href="#_note-Ridley" title="">[4]</a></sup> and partly by the use of <a href="/DNA_sequence" title="DNA sequence">DNA sequence</a> data in taxonomy. An example is: the way <a href="/Derived" title="Derived">derived</a> groups like birds should not be classified at the same level as the group they evolved from. Yet birds have traditionally been a <a href="/Class_(biology)" title="Class (biology)">class</a> under the Linnaean system.</p>
<p>The turmoil sometimes results in differences between related pages. Pages may rely on different references and different authors' opinions as to the present best arrangement.</p>
