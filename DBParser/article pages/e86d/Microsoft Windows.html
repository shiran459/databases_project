<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The first version of Windows came out on November 20, 1985 and was called <a href="/Windows_1.0" title="Windows 1.0">Windows 1.0</a>. Since then, new versions of Windows go on sale every three years. The newest version, <a href="/Windows_10" title="Windows 10">Windows 10</a>, came out July 29, 2015. Most newly bought <a href="/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computers</a> come with Windows 10, although some older or cheaper ones may have older versions such as <a href="/Windows_8.1" title="Windows 8.1">Windows 8.1</a> or <a href="/Windows_7" title="Windows 7">Windows 7</a> installed.</p>
<p>Windows makes it easier to run <a href="/Computer_software" title="Computer software">programs</a> (applications) than <a href="/MS-DOS" title="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> did. To use <a href="/DOS" title="DOS">DOS</a>, you <a href="/Typing" title="Typing">typed</a> <a href="/Command_Line_Interface" title="Command Line Interface">commands</a> to make the computer do something. You had to use the correct <a href="/Syntax" title="Syntax">syntax</a> of each command. If you made a mistake, the computer usually gave an <a href="/Error" title="Error">error</a> message and did nothing.</p>

<p>Windows makes it easier to do things because of its <a href="/Graphical_user_interfaces_and_consoles" title="Graphical user interfaces and consoles">graphical user interface</a> (or GUI for short).  It only needs a keyboard <i>or</i> a <a href="/Computer_mouse" title="Computer mouse">mouse</a> to work. However, using both a keyboard and a mouse makes it easier to use Windows. By clicking a few <a href="/Button_(control)" title="Button (control)">buttons</a> on the screen, Windows helps keep your files safe, and easier to change and move. The latest versions of Windows also work with <a href="/Touch_screen" title="Touch screen">touch screens</a>, making it even easier to use for <a href="/Accessibility" title="Accessibility">users with disabilities</a>. Because of this, Windows even comes on some <a href="/Tablet_computer" title="Tablet computer">tablet computers</a> and <a href="/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a>.  <a href="/Mobile_device" title="Mobile device">Mobile devices</a> that use Windows include <a href="/Microsoft_Surface" title="Microsoft Surface">Microsoft Surface</a> and <a href="/Microsoft_Lumia" title="Microsoft Lumia">Microsoft Lumia</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Programs">Programs</span></h2>
<p>Some programs are included with Windows. Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/WordPad" title="WordPad">WordPad</a> – to write simple documents, typically using words/text.</li>
<li>Windows Photo Viewer – to look at pictures.</li>
<li><a href="/Microsoft_Paint" title="Microsoft Paint">Microsoft Paint</a> – to make simple drawings or change pictures.</li>
<li><a href="/Microsoft_Edge" title="Microsoft Edge">Microsoft Edge</a> web browser – to use the <a href="/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> to look at <a href="/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">web</a> pages and <a href="/Download" title="Download">download</a> files.</li>
<li>Windows DVD Player to watch videos. </li>
<li>Windows Groove to play and listen to music </li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Many users complain that Windows creates problems for them. Some people say that their computers become slower/less fast when they changed form DOS to Windows. Many people also complain about problems that make their computer less safe to use, even though Microsoft tries to fix these problems. Because Windows was until recently the most popular operating system (today mobile operating systems such as Android are more popular), most <a href="/Computer_virus" title="Computer virus">computer viruses</a> are created to infect computers running Windows. {{fact|date=February 2015}}</p>
