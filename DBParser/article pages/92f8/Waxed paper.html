<b>Waxed paper</b> (or <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wax">wax</a> <a href="/Paper" title="Paper">paper</a>) is a type of paper which has been coated on both sides with wax. This gives it a <a href="/Translucent" title="Translucent">translucent</a> look. It is used for wrapping <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a> because <a href="/Vegetable_oil" title="Vegetable oil">grease</a>, <a href="/Oil" title="Oil">oil</a>, and <a href="/Water" title="Water">water</a> cannot pass through it. It is also used to line food <a href="/Container" title="Container">containers</a> because many kinds of food which would stick to <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/normal">normal</a> paper will not stick to wax paper. Many kinds of dry foods were once stored in wax paper because of its <a href="/Resistance" title="Resistance">resistance</a> to water. Wax paper has been replaced by <a href="/Plastic" title="Plastic">plastic</a> wrap for most purposes.</p>
