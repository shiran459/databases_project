<p>A <b>boot device</b> is used to start a <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a>.  It is named after a <a href="/Boot" title="Boot">boot</a> which fits on the <a href="/Foot" title="Foot">foot</a>.  The word <a href="/Bootstrap" title="Bootstrap">bootstrap</a> is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. It comes from the English phrase "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps."</p>
<p>Before a computer can operate normally, it must have <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions.  A boot device loads the operating system into the <a href="/Memory" title="Memory">memory</a> of the computer. </p>
<p>Devices that can boot a computer are usually <b>boot disks</b> or <b>boot drives</b> 
(normally a <a href="/Hard_drive" title="Hard drive">hard drive</a>, but can be a <a href="/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">floppy disk</a> or a <a href="/Compact_disk" title="Compact disk">CD</a>).  Some <a href="/Network_computer" title="Network computer">network computers</a> use <i>boot chips</i> that get the <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> over a <a href="/Network" title="Network">network</a>.  <a href="/Web_phone" title="Web phone">Web phones</a> also use such chips to identify the user to the <a href="/Cell_network" title="Cell network">cell network</a>.  <b>Boot card</b> standards may let many users boot <a href="/Kiosk_computer" title="Kiosk computer">kiosk computers</a> with full <a href="/Privacy" title="Privacy">privacy</a> and access to all <a href="/Applications" title="Applications">applications</a> they own. There are also <b>boot boards</b> or <b>boot <i>add-in</i> cards</b> that are more permanent than boot cards.</p>
<p>Some people refer to the boot device as just a <b>boot</b> and non-boot devices as <b>data device</b>s, although it is not the <a href="/Computer" title="Computer">computer</a> but the <a href="/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a> that cares about the difference between these.</p>

<p>The boot in <b>boot device</b> is the same as <a href="/Booting" title="Booting">booting</a> (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.</p>
