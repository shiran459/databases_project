<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Democracy">Democracy</span></h3>
<p>The most common type of government in the Western world is called <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. In democracies, people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer. The people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on <a href="/Legislature" title="Legislature">legislatures</a> such as the <a href="/Parliament" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> or <a href="/Congress" title="Congress">Congress</a>. <a href="/Political_party" title="Political party">Political parties</a> are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people. </p>
<p>However, many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters. One of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament, or limit the parties access to mass media such as television. Another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power. Few countries are textbook democracies, and the differences between them has been much studied.<sup class="reference" id="_ref-1"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-2"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="_ref-3"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Monarchy">Monarchy</span></h3>
<p>A <a href="/Monarchy" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family, which is often called the "royal family." There are two types of monarchies: absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies. In an absolute monarchy, the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers. In a <a href="/Constitutional_monarchy" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> a ruler's powers are limited by a document called a <a href="/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aristocracy">Aristocracy</span></h3>
<p>An <a href="/Aristocracy" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> is a government by the "best" people. A person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat. Aristocracy is different from nobility, in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule, an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule, or that rulers be chosen in a different manner.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dictatorship">Dictatorship</span></h3>
<p>Under a <a href="/Dictatorship" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a>, the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country. Originally, the <a href="/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> made dictators to lead during time of war. The Roman dictators (and Greek <a href="/Tyrant" title="Tyrant">tyrants</a>) were not always bad. The Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, a dictator's rule is not stopped by any laws, constitutions, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by dictators. Examples of dictators include <a href="/Josef_Stalin" title="Josef Stalin">Josef Stalin</a>, <a href="/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, Augusto Pinochet,  <a href="/Idi_Amin" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a>, <a href="/Muammar_al-Qaddafi" title="Muammar al-Qaddafi">Muammar al-Qaddafi</a>, and <a href="/Gamal_Abdul_Nasser" title="Gamal Abdul Nasser">Gamal Abdul Nasser</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oligarchy">Oligarchy</span></h3>
<p>An <a href="/Oligarchy" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people. These people may spread power equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler, but several powerful people. Some past examples of oligarchy are the former <a href="/Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics" title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</a> and <a href="/Apartheid" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> <a href="/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. A fictional example is the <a href="/Dystopia" title="Dystopia">dystopian</a> society of <i>Oceania</i> in the book <a href="/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>. Some critics of <a href="/Representative_democracy" title="Representative democracy">representative democracy</a> think of the <a href="/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> as an oligarchy. This view is shared by <a href="/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchists</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_history_and_the_theory_of_government">The history and the theory of government</span></h2>

<p>The simplest idea of government is those who <a href="/Rule" title="Rule">rule</a> over <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/people">people</a> and <a href="/Land" title="Land">land</a>. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a <a href="/Village" title="Village">village</a> or as big as a <a href="/Continent" title="Continent">continent</a> (like <a href="/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="/India" title="India">India</a>). </p>
<p>Those people who rule the land can allow others to <a href="/Own" title="Own">own</a> it. It is a <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deed">deed</a> by government that gives this right in the way that <a href="/Law" title="Law">laws</a> describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission. This view is called <a href="/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a>. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in <a href="/Peace" title="Peace">peace</a>, without government. This view is called <a href="/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>. </p>
<p>Almost every place on <a href="/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> is connected to one and only one government. Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small <a href="/Border_dispute" title="Border dispute">border disputed</a> areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims 'sovereign control' over it. The word "sovereign" is old and means "control by a <a href="/King" title="King">King</a>" (<a href="/Sovereign" title="Sovereign">sovereign</a>). Governments of <a href="/Village" title="Village">villages</a>, <a href="/City" title="City">cities</a>, <a href="/County" title="County">counties</a> and other <a href="/Community" title="Community">communities</a> are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the <a href="/Country" title="Country">country</a>.</p>
<p>It is from Kings and <a href="/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a> that modern governments and <a href="/Nation_state" title="Nation state">nation states</a> came. The <a href="/Capital_(city)" title="Capital (city)">capital</a> of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his <a href="/Asset" title="Asset">assets</a>. From this we get the modern idea of <a href="/Capital_(economics)" title="Capital (economics)">capital</a> in <a href="/Economics" title="Economics">economics</a>. A government is said to <a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/regulation">regulate</a> <a href="/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a> as well as to rule over land.</p>
<p>Governments also control people and decide things about what <a href="/Morality" title="Morality">morality</a> to accept or <a href="/Punish" title="Punish">punish</a>. In very many countries, there are strict rules about <a href="/Sexual_intercourse" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> and <a href="/Drug" title="Drug">drugs</a> that are part of <a href="/Law" title="Law">law</a> and offenders are punished for disobeying them.</p>
<p><a href="/Tax" title="Tax">Tax</a> is how government is paid for in most countries. People who <a href="/Buy" title="Buy">buy</a>, <a href="/Sales" title="Sales">sell</a>, <a href="/Import" title="Import">import</a>, <a href="/Invest" title="Invest">invest</a>, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the <a href="/Money" title="Money">money</a> to a government.</p>
<p>There are many theories of how to organize government better. These are called theories of <a href="/Civics" title="Civics">civics</a>. Because government is run by people who can be greedy, many people think <a href="/Leader" title="Leader">leaders</a> must be <a href="/Elect" title="Elect">elected</a> by some kind of <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. That way, if government does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next <a href="/Election" title="Election">election</a>. Still many countries' governments are not a <a href="/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> but other forms in which only a few people have power.</p>
<p>There are many theories of how to run a government better, and keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of <a href="/Politics" title="Politics">politics</a>. No matter how a government is chosen, it must do politics to keep <a href="/Influence" title="Influence">power</a>.</p>
